abstract: The local linear trend and global linear trend models embody extreme 
    assumptions about trends. According to the local linear trend formulation 
    the level and growth rate are allowed to rapidly adapt to changes in the 
    data path. On the other hand, the Glaobal linear trend model makes no 
    allowance for structural change. In this paper we introduce a new model that, 
    as well as encompassing the global linear trend and local linear trend models, 
    allows for a range of "in between" cases.

abstract: This paper considers the analysis of cointegrated time series using principal

    normalisation imposed by the triangular eror correction model, nor the

abstract: It is well known that the usual techniques for estimating random and fixed 
    effects panel data models are inconsistent in the dynamic setting. As a 
    consequence, numerous consistent estimators have been proposed in the 
    literature. However, all such estimators rely on certain well defined 
    assumption, which in practice my be violated.The purpose of this paper is 
    to ascertain how robust the available estimators are to such misspecifications, 
    thus providing guidance to applied researcher as to an appropriate choice of 
    estimator in such situation.

abstract: The analysis of economic time series assumes specific economic behaviour of 
    a representative agent. The data used in analysis is generated by aggregating 
    observations of all individuals in a population. This is valid only if all 
    members of a population have the same data generating process, but what 
    happens if their behaviour is heterogeneous? This paper examines the properties 
    of test statistics for cointegration when the aggregate data consists of 
    heterogeneous individuals.
