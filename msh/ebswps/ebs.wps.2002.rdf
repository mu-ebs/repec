Abstract: Given that it is quite impractical to use standard model selection criteria in a nonlinear modeling context, the builders of nonlinear models often choose lag length by setting it equal to the lag length chosen for a linear autoregression of the data.  This paper studies the performance of this procedure in a variety of circumstances, and then proposes some new and simple model selection procedures, based on linear approximations of the nonlinear forms. The idea here is to apply standard selection criteria to these linear approximations, rather than to autoregressions that make no provision for nonlinear behavior. A simulation study compares the properties of these proposed procedures with the properties of linear selection procedures.

Abstract: This paper studies linear and nonlinear autoregressive leading indicator models of business cycles in G7 countries. The models use the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates as leading indicators for GDP, and their success in capturing business cycles is gauged by non-parametric shape tests, and their ability to predict the probability of recession.  We find that bivariate nonlinear models of output and the interest rate spread can successfully capture the shape of the business cycle in cases where linear models fail.  Also, our nonlinear leading indicator models for USA, Canada and the UK outperform other models of GDP with respect to predicting the probability of recession.

Length: 27 pages
Abstract: Influence diagnostics have become an important tool for statistical analysis since the seminal work by Cook (1986).  In this paper we present a curvature-based diagnostic to access local influence of minor perturbations on the modified likelihood displacement in a regression model.  Using the proposed diagnostic, we study the local influence in the GARCH model under two perturbation schemes which involve, respectively, model perturbation and data perturbation.  We find that the curvature-based diagnostic often provides more information on the local influence being examined than the slope-based diagnostic, especially when the GARCH model is under investigation.  An empirical study involving GARCH modeling of the percentage daily returns of the NYSE composite index illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed diagnostic and shows that the curvature-based diagnostic may provide information that cannot be uncovered by the slope-based diagnostic.  We find that the effect or influence of each observation is not invariant across different perturbation schemes, thus it is advisable to study the local influence under different perturbation schemes through curvature-based diagnostics.

Abstract: In this paper we propose a Bayesian method for estimating hyperbolic diffusion models.  The approach is based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method after discretization via the Milstein scheme.  Our simulation study shows that the hyperbolic diffusion exhibits many of the stylized facts about asset returns documented in the financial econometrics literature, such as slowly declining autocorrelation function of absolute terms.  We demonstrate that the MCMC method provides a useful tool to analyze hyperbolic diffusions.  In particular, quantities of posterior distributions obtained from MCMC outputs can be used for statistical inferences.

Abstract: This paper proposes a class of stochastic volatility (SV) models which offers an alternative to the one introduced in Andersen (1994).  The class encompasses all standard SV models that have appeared in the literature, including the well known lognormal model, and allows us to empirically test all standard specifications in a convenient way.  We develop a likelihood-based technique for analyzing the class. Daily dollar/pound exchange rate data reject all the standard models and suggest evidence of nonlinear SV.  An efficient algorithm is proposed to study the implications of this nonlinear SV on pricing currency options and it is found that the lognormal model overprices options.

Length: 34 pages
Abstract: The issue of the relative returns to farmers from R&D and promotion is examined using a multi-sectoral equilibrium displacement model of the Australian beef industry. Total economic surplus changes and their distributions among various industry groups resulting from 1% cost reductions in various farm and off-farm sectors, and from 1% price premiums from domestic and export market promotion, are estimated. The results are consistent with previous studies in showing that in general, the share of total benefits to farmers is larger from on-farm research than from most off-farm research, and is larger from most types of research than from domestic promotion. The share of total benefits to farmers is larger from export promotion than from off-farm research, and from domestic promotion. The net returns from the different cost-reduction or demand-enhancing scenarios depend on the costs of achieving them.

Title: Who Bears the Burden and Who Receives the Gain? - The Case of GWRDC R&D Investments in the Australian Grape and Wine Industry

Keywords: Economics of R&D, R&D policies, incidence of levies, wine, equilibrium displacement modelling.
Length: 16 pages
Abstract: In 2001, $13 million were invested in various grape and wine R&D programs via the Australian Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation. Half of the funds come from compulsory levies from grape-growers and winemakers, and the other half from Commonwealth government matching grants. These funds are then allocated to research projects across broad areas such as grape production R&D, wine production R&D and grape and wine quality R&D.
The benefit of R&D in one sector of an industry will be distributed across the production and consumption chain. On the other hand, when a levy is charged nominally to one producer group, the real burden of the cost will also be shared among all involved producer and consumer groups. In the case of the Australian grape and wine R&D investments, the net impact will be determined by the distribution of the benefits and costs across grape-growers, winemakers, marketers and retailers, and domestic and overseas consumers. In an ideal situation, if every dollar is invested at exactly the point where it is collected, the percentage distributions of costs and returns coincide. Under this system, presuming R&D projects are successful, all groups will gain in dollar terms, and they will receive benefits in exactly the same proportions as how the burdens of the R&D costs are shared. However, the distributions of costs and benefits will diverge if a levy collected at one point of the production is used to fund research at a different point of the chain. Indeed, in practice, producers often pool levies together to fund R&D programs at places that are not necessarily where the funds are raised. A significant amount of public funds are also invested in Australian agricultural industries that substantially involve foreign processors and consumers. In these situations it is important to note the real incidence of both costs and benefits.
The objective of the paper is to examine the distributions of both costs and returns from the Australian grape and wine R&D investments, using results from a multi-sectoral equilibrium displacement model of the industry. The real shares of total R&D costs are estimated and compared with the nominal shares. Divergence between the distributions of costs and benefits is also studied for the three major areas of R&D. Grape-growers, winemakers and overseas consumers are shown to receive bigger proportions of the gains than their proportions of costs, but the Government and other domestic parties as a group bear a much higher proportion of costs than returns. The paper discusses implications of the results to the equity issue between premium and non-premium wine producers, the free-rider issue for overseas consumers, and the issue of justifying government funding of grape and wine R&D.

Length: 31 pages
Abstract: A Kalman filter, suitable for application to a stationary or a non-stationary time series, is proposed. It works on time series with missing values. It can be used on seasonal time series where the associated state space model may not satisfy the traditional observability condition.  A new concept called an 'extended normal random vector' is introduced and used throughout the paper to simplify the specification of the Kalman filter. It is an aggregate of means, variances, covariances and other information needed to define the state of a system at a given point in time. By working with this aggregate, the algorithm is specified without direct recourse to those relatively complex formulae for calculating associated means and variances, normally found in traditional expositions of the Kalman filter. A computer implementation of the algorithm is also described where the extended normal random vector is treated as an object; the operations of addition, subtraction and multiplication are overloaded to work on instances of this object; and a form of statistical conditioning is implemented as an operator.

Length: 39 pages
Abstract: Empirical tests of option pricing models are joint tests of the 'correctness' of the model, the efficiency of the market and the simultaneity of price observations. Some degree of nonsimultaeity can be expected in all but the most liquid markets and is therefore evident in many non-US markets. Simulation results indicate that nonsimultaneity is potentially a significant problem in empirical tests of futures option pricing models. Empirical results using Australian data show that a five-minute window for matching transactions does not remove the nonsimultaneity bias for near-the-money and out-of-the money options. A more accurate matching may therefore be required. The nonsimultaneity bias is effectively removed if a five-minute window is employed for in-the-money options.

Length: 23 pages
Abstract: Consider the following two opinions, both of which can be found in the literature of consumer demand systems: (a) As the real income of a consumer becomes indefinitely large, re-mixing the consumption bundle becomes irrelevant: having chosen the ultimately satisfying budget shares at any given set of relative prices, the superlatively wealthy continue to allocate additional income in the same proportions. With very large and increasing per capita income, ultimately the utility function becomes indistinguishable from Cobb-Douglas.  (b) Consumer demand systems in which the income elasticities monotonically approach one (from above, in the case of luxuries; from below, in the case of necessities) are unsatisfactory both theoretically and empirically. For instance, a necessity with a low (< 1) income elasticity may very well become less elastic with further increases in income. The issue is important for CGE modelers because explicit direct additivity (as in the linear expenditure system [LES]) is often the modeler's default choice: this leaves us firmly in the world of (a). Hanoch's implicit direct additivity exhibits very flexible Engel properties. Rimmer and Powell's AIDADS system belongs to this class. Within such a system it is possible to satisfy the motivations underlying both (a) and (b), as illustrated by the Engel (income) elasticities for a 3-commodity AIDADS system shown below in Figure 1. Whilst the system eventually converges to Cobb-Douglas, some income elasticities can be effectively zero at any imaginable actual income level. Inferiority can also be accommodated over a range of incomes. This paper discusses the above in more detail, strengthening the case for implicit direct additivity. An experimental calibration of a database to the AIDADS system is illustrated with modifications made to the ORANI-G teaching model. A technical appendix establishes the effectively global regularity of AIDADS.

Abstract: The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is used to describe the performance of a diagnostic test which classifies observations into two groups. We introduce a new method for selecting bandwidths when computing kernel estimates of ROC curves. Our technique allows for interaction between the distributions of each group of observations and gives substantial improvement in MISE over other proposed methods, especially when the two distributions are very different.

Length: 19 pages
Abstract: We show how cubic smoothing splines fitted to univariate time series data can be used to obtain local linear forecasts. Our approach is based on a stochastic state space model which allows the use of a likelihood approach for estimating the smoothing parameter, and which enables easy construction of prediction intervals. We show that our model is a special case of an ARIMA(0,2,2) model and we provide a simple upper bound for the smoothing parameter to ensure an invertible model. We also show that the spline model is not a special case of Holt's local linear trend method. Finally we compare the spline forecasts with Holt's forecasts and those obtained from the full ARIMA(0,2,2) model, showing that the restricted parameter space does not impair forecast performance.

Abstract: The principle that the simplest model capable of describing observed phenomena should also correspond to the best description has long been a guiding rule of inference.  In this paper a Bayesian approach to formally implementing this principle is employed to develop model selection criteria for detecting structural change in financial and economic time series.  Model selection criteria which allow for multiple structural breaks and which seek the optimal model order and parameter choices within regimes are derived.  Comparative simulations against other popular information based model selection criteria are performed.  Application of the derived criteria are also made to example financial and economic time series.

Keywords: Generalized extreme value; Choice set generation; Ordinal data
Length: 35 pages
Abstract: At present, there appears to be no qualitative dependent model that can simultaneously account for data sets in which the variable of interest is potentially ordered but also has strong heterogeneity of the observed outcomes.  This heterogeneity of particular outcomes, inherently attracts individuals to them, in addition to that determined by the individual's observed characteristics.  An example of such unobserved heterogeneity would be brand-loyalty (or "captivity") in a model of consumer choice. Such heterogeneity of the outcomes, may well result in a pronounced multi-modal distribution of the variable of interest. This paper introduces the Dogit Ordered Generalized Extreme Value (DOGEV) model, which does account for both ordering and captivity (and/or multiple modes) in the data. In the spirit of Manski (1977), the DOGEV model combines a model for choice set generation with the Ordered Generalized Extreme Value model. We illustrate the model using three different empirical examples: a model of employment contract types; an inflationary expectations data set and; a survey of students' evaluations of teaching. These three examples are chosen as they represent different values that the additional ancillary parameters are likely to take in practice.

Length: 32 pages
Abstract: To be useful for realistic policy simulation in an environment of rapid structural change, inverse demand systems must remain regular over substantial variations in quantities. The distance function is a convenient vehicle for generating such systems. While it directly yields Hicksian inverse demand functions, those functions will not usually have an explicit representation in terms of the observable variables. Note however that this problem need not hinder estimation and could be solved by using the numerical inversion estimation approach. This paper develops the formal theory for using distance functions in this context, and demonstrates the operational feasibility of the method.

Length: 26 pages
Abstract: This paper develops a new non-linear model to analyse the business cycle by exploiting the relationship between the asymmetrical behaviour of the cycle and leading indicators. The model proposed is an innovations form of the structural model underlying simple exponential smoothing that is augmented by a latent Markov switching process. Furthermore, the probabilities that drive the Markov process vary with the growth of the leading indicator. The proposed model is used to analyse the Australian business cycle using the gross domestic product as a proxy and the industrial materials prices index as the exogenous leading indicator influencing the transition probabilities. Model parameters are estimated using a Gibbs sampling algorithm and subsequently used for forecasting purposes.

Keywords: Option pricing; volatility frowns; thin-tails; generalized Student t.
Length: 37 pages
Abstract: Volatility smiles arise in currency option markets when empirical exchange rate returns distributions exhibit leptokurtosis. This feature of empirical distributions is symptomatic of turbulent periods when exchange rate movements are in excess of movements based on the assumption of normality. In contrast, during periods of tranquility, movements in exchange rates are relatively small, resulting in unconditional empirical returns distributions with thinner tails than the normal distribution. Pricing currency options during tranquil periods on the assumption of normal returns yields implied volatility frowns, with over-pricing at both deep-in and deep-out-of-the-money contracts and under-pricing for at-the-money contracts. This paper shows how a parametric class of thin-tailed distributions based on the generalized Student t family of distributions can price currency options during periods of tranquility.

Keywords: Forecasting; inventory control; lead-time demand; exponential smoothing; forecast variance.
Length: 14 pages
Abstract: Exponential smoothing is often used to forecast lead-time demand for inventory control. In this paper, formulae are provided for calculating means and variances of lead-time demand for a wide variety of exponential smoothing methods. A feature of many of the formulae is that variances, as well as the means, depend on trends and seasonal effects. Thus, these formulae provide the opportunity to implement methods that ensure that safety stocks adjust to changes in trend or changes in season.

Keywords: Option Pricing; Stochastic Volatility; Volatility Risk; Bayesian Implicit Inference; Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
Length: 40 pages
Abstract: In this paper we apply Bayesian methods to estimate a stochastic volatility model using both the prices of the asset and the prices of options written on the asset. Implicit posterior densities for the parameters of the volatility model, for the latent volatilities and for the market price of volatility risk are produced. The method involves augmenting the data generating process associated with a panel of option prices with the probability  density function describing the dynamics of the underlying bivariate spot price and volatility process. Posterior  results are produced via a hybrid Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. Candidate draws which  assume a given dynamic process for the volatility are re-weighted according to the information in both the  option and spot price data. The method is illustrated using the Heston (1993) stochastic volatility model,  based on data simulated to mimic the features of recent S&P500 spot and option price data. The way in which  alternative option pricing models can be ranked, via Bayes Factors and via fit, predictive and hedging  performance, is demonstrated.

Keywords: Option Pricing; Volatility Smiles and Skews; Generalized Student t; Skewness; Kurtosis;  Time-Varying Volatility.
Length: 47 pages
Abstract: A general parametric framework is developed for pricing S&P500 options. Skewness and leptokurtosis in stock returns as well as time-varying volatility are priced. The parametric pricing model nests the Black-Scholes model and can explain volatility smiles and skews in stock options. The data consist of S&P500 options traded on select days in April, 1995, a total sample of over 500,000 observations. A number of performance criteria are used to evaluate the alternative models. The empirical results show that pricing higher order moments yield improvements in the pricing of options over the Black-Scholes model as well as other models.
