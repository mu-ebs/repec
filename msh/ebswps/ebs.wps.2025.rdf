Abstract: This paper proposes a novel time-varying model averaging (TVMA) approach to
enhancing forecast accuracy for multivariate time series subject to structural changes.
The TVMA method averages predictions from a set of time-varying vector autoregressive
models using optimal time-varying combination weights selected by minimizing a
penalized local criterion. This allows the relative importance of different models to
adaptively evolve over time in response to structural shifts. We establish an asymptotic
optimality for the proposed TVMA approach in achieving the lowest possible quadratic
forecast errors. The convergence rate of the selected time-varying weights to the
optimal weights minimizing expected quadratic errors is derived. Moreover, we show
that when one or more correctly specified models exist, our method consistently assigns
full weight to them, and an asymptotic normality for the TVMA estimators under some
regularity conditions can be established. Furthermore, the proposed approach
encompasses special cases including time-varying VAR models with exogenous predictors,
as well as time-varying factor augmented VAR (FAVAR) models. Simulations and an empirical
application illustrate the proposed TVMA method outperforms some commonly used model
averaging and selection methods in the presence of structural changes.
