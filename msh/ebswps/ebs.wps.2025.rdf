Abstract: This paper predicts the emergence of an ice-free Arctic using a nonlinear
endogenous co-trending regression model. The model captures the nonlinear
co-trending relationship between Arctic sea ice extent (SIE) and regional
surface temperatures, which are influenced by long-run factors such as radiative 
forcing from greenhouse gases (GHG) and the Atlantic Multidecadal
Oscillation (AMO) index. By conditioning the analysis on various Representative 
Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for future GHG emissions and
projected AMO cyclical patterns, we offer long-term predictions of Arctic
SIE. Our findings indicate the likely emergence of an ice-free Arctic before
2050 under the worst-case emission scenario.

Keywords: homogeneity, heterogeneity, weak and strong cross-sectional dependence,
Gaussian approximation, (non)stationary panel
Abstract: In this paper, we define an underlying data generating process that allows for
different magnitudes of cross-sectional dependence, along with time series autocorrelation. 
This is achieved via high-dimensional moving average processes of infinite
order (HDMA(&infin;)). Our setup and investigation integrates and enhances homogenous and 
heterogeneous panel data estimation and testing in a unified way. To study
HDMA(&infin;), we extend the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition to a high-dimensional
time series setting, and derive a complete toolkit set. We exam homogeneity versus
heterogeneity using Gaussian approximation, a prevalent technique for establishing 
uniform inference. For post-testing inference, we derive central limit theorems
through Edgeworth expansions for both homogenous and heterogeneous settings.
Additionally, we showcase the practical relevance of the established asymptotic
properties by revisiting the common correlated effects (CCE) estimators, and a
classic nonstationary panel data process. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings
via extensive numerical studies using both simulated and real datasets.

Keywords: asymptotic optimality, consistency, structural change, time-varying weight
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel time-varying model averaging (TVMA) approach to
enhancing forecast accuracy for multivariate time series subject to structural changes.
The TVMA method averages predictions from a set of time-varying vector autoregressive
models using optimal time-varying combination weights selected by minimizing a
penalized local criterion. This allows the relative importance of different models to
adaptively evolve over time in response to structural shifts. We establish an asymptotic
optimality for the proposed TVMA approach in achieving the lowest possible quadratic
forecast errors. The convergence rate of the selected time-varying weights to the
optimal weights minimizing expected quadratic errors is derived. Moreover, we show
that when one or more correctly specified models exist, our method consistently assigns
full weight to them, and an asymptotic normality for the TVMA estimators under some
regularity conditions can be established. Furthermore, the proposed approach
encompasses special cases including time-varying VAR models with exogenous predictors,
as well as time-varying factor augmented VAR (FAVAR) models. Simulations and an empirical
application illustrate the proposed TVMA method outperforms some commonly used model
averaging and selection methods in the presence of structural changes.
