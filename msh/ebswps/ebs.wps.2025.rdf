time-series, MA(&infin;) representation
Abstract: We consider a general class of dynamic network autoregressions for 
high-dimensional time series with network dependence, extending existing dynamic 
models by allowing for timevarying model coefficients, cross-sectionally dependent 
errors and a general network structure smoothly evolving along the time. A 
nonparametric local linear kernel method is proposed to estimate these time-varying 
coefficients involved, and a recursive-design bootstrap procedure is developed to 
construct valid confidence intervals for time-varying coefficients in the
presence of cross-sectional dependent errors. We establish asymptotic properties 
for the proposed local-linear based estimator and the bootstrap procedure under 
mild conditions. Both the proposed estimation and bootstrap procedures are 
illustrated using simulated and two real datasets. Our work contributes to 
high-dimensional time series associated with network effects and sheds light on 
bootstrap inference for locally stationary processes.

Keywords: estimation theory, Kalman filter, nonstationarity, resampling technique
Abstract: This paper introduces a theoretically robust framework for conditional mean 
estimation associated with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in state space models
with nonstationary time series, integrating the classical Kalman filter with Bayesian
inference. We propose a dierence-based approach using optimally designed summary
statistics from observable data, overcoming the intractability of traditional Kalman filter
statistics reliant on latent states. Our formulation creates a direct mapping between
feasible statistics and structural parameters, enabling clean separation between state
dynamics and measurement noise. Under mild regularity conditions, we prove the
consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimators, achieving the Cramrr-Rao
lower bound for eciency. The methodology extends to non-Gaussian innovations with
finite moments, ensuring robustness. Monte Carlo approximations preserve asymptotic
eciency under controlled sampling rates, while finite sample bounds and robustness
to model misspecification and data contamination confirm reliability. These theoretical
advances are complemented by a comprehensive simulation study demonstrating superior 
performance compared to conventional approaches. These results advance the
theoretical foundations of state space modelling, providing a statistically ecient and
computationally feasible alternative to conventional approaches.

Abstract: The fungal disease Chytridiomycosis poses a threat to frog populations 
worldwide. It has driven over 90 amphibian species to extinction and severely affected
hundreds more. Difficulties in disease management have shown a need for novel
conservation approaches.
We present a novel mathematical model for chytridiomycosis transmission in
frogs that includes the natural history of infection, to test the hypothesis that
sunlight-heated refugia reduce transmission. This model was fit using approximate 
Bayesian computation to experimental data where frogs were grouped into
sunlight-heated or shaded refugia cohorts.
Results show a 40% reduction in infection due to sunlight-heating of refugia. 
Frogs that were infected and recovered had a reduction in susceptibility of
approximately 97% compared to na¨ıve frogs. Our model offers insight into using
sunlight-heated refugia to reduce chytridiomycosis prevalence. Importantly, it is
the first step in determining the necessary level of refugia in the landscape for
frog population recovery and population sustainability.

Abstract: Constructing efficient risk-limiting audits (RLAs) for multiwinner 
single transferable vote (STV) elections is a challenging problem.
An STV RLA is designed to statistically verify that the reported winners
of an election did indeed win according to the voters' expressed preferences 
and not due to mistabulation or interference, while limiting the
risk of accepting an incorrect outcome to a desired threshold (the risk
limit). Existing methods have shown that it is possible to form RLAs
for two-seat STV elections in the context where the first seat has been
awarded to a candidate in the first round of tabulation. This is called the
first winner criterion. We present an assertion-based approach to conducting 
full or partial RLAs for STV elections with three or more seats,
in which the first winner criterion is satisfied. Although the chance of
forming a full audit that verifies all winners drops substantially as the
number of seats increases, we show that we can quite often form partial
audits that verify most, and sometimes all, of the reported winners. We
evaluate our method on a dataset of over 500 three- and four-seat STV
elections from the 2017 and 2022 local council elections in Scotland

Keywords: single transferable vote, risk-limiting audit, margin of
victory, mismatch-based audit
Abstract: One approach to risk-limiting audits (RLAs) compares randomly 
selected cast vote records (CVRs) to votes read by human auditors
from the corresponding ballot cards. Historically, such methods reduce
audit sample sizes by considering how each sampled CVR differs from
the corresponding true vote, not merely whether they differ. Here we
investigate the latter approach, auditing by testing whether the total
number of mismatches in the full set of CVRs exceeds the minimum
number of CVR errors required for the reported outcome to be wrong
(the "CVR margin"). This strategy makes it possible to audit more social
choice functions and simplifies RLAs conceptually, which makes it easier
to explain than some other RLA approaches. The cost is larger sample
sizes. "Mismatch-based RLAs" only require a lower bound on the CVR
margin, which for some social choice functions is easier to calculate than
the effect of particular errors. When the population rate of mismatches
is low and the lower bound on the CVR margin is close to the true CVR
margin, the increase in sample size is small. However, the increase may
be very large when errors include errors that, if corrected, would widen
the CVR margin rather than narrow it; errors affect the margin between
candidates other than the reported winner with the fewest votes and the
reported loser with the most votes; or errors that affect different
margins.

Abstract: This paper predicts the emergence of an ice-free Arctic using a nonlinear
endogenous co-trending regression model. The model captures the nonlinear
co-trending relationship between Arctic sea ice extent (SIE) and regional
surface temperatures, which are influenced by long-run factors such as radiative 
forcing from greenhouse gases (GHG) and the Atlantic Multidecadal
Oscillation (AMO) index. By conditioning the analysis on various Representative 
Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for future GHG emissions and
projected AMO cyclical patterns, we offer long-term predictions of Arctic
SIE. Our findings indicate the likely emergence of an ice-free Arctic before
2050 under the worst-case emission scenario.

Keywords: homogeneity, heterogeneity, weak and strong cross-sectional dependence,
Gaussian approximation, (non)stationary panel
Abstract: In this paper, we define an underlying data generating process that allows for
different magnitudes of cross-sectional dependence, along with time series autocorrelation. 
This is achieved via high-dimensional moving average processes of infinite
order (HDMA(&infin;)). Our setup and investigation integrates and enhances homogenous and 
heterogeneous panel data estimation and testing in a unified way. To study
HDMA(&infin;), we extend the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition to a high-dimensional
time series setting, and derive a complete toolkit set. We exam homogeneity versus
heterogeneity using Gaussian approximation, a prevalent technique for establishing 
uniform inference. For post-testing inference, we derive central limit theorems
through Edgeworth expansions for both homogenous and heterogeneous settings.
Additionally, we showcase the practical relevance of the established asymptotic
properties by revisiting the common correlated effects (CCE) estimators, and a
classic nonstationary panel data process. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings
via extensive numerical studies using both simulated and real datasets.

Keywords: asymptotic optimality, consistency, structural change, time-varying weight
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel time-varying model averaging (TVMA) approach to
enhancing forecast accuracy for multivariate time series subject to structural changes.
The TVMA method averages predictions from a set of time-varying vector autoregressive
models using optimal time-varying combination weights selected by minimizing a
penalized local criterion. This allows the relative importance of different models to
adaptively evolve over time in response to structural shifts. We establish an asymptotic
optimality for the proposed TVMA approach in achieving the lowest possible quadratic
forecast errors. The convergence rate of the selected time-varying weights to the
optimal weights minimizing expected quadratic errors is derived. Moreover, we show
that when one or more correctly specified models exist, our method consistently assigns
full weight to them, and an asymptotic normality for the TVMA estimators under some
regularity conditions can be established. Furthermore, the proposed approach
encompasses special cases including time-varying VAR models with exogenous predictors,
as well as time-varying factor augmented VAR (FAVAR) models. Simulations and an empirical
application illustrate the proposed TVMA method outperforms some commonly used model
averaging and selection methods in the presence of structural changes.
