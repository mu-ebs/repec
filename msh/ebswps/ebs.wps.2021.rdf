Keywords: loss-based Bayesian forecasting, variational inference, Gibbs posteriors, proper scoring
rules, Bayesian neural networks, M4 forecasting competition
Abstract: We propose a new method for Bayesian prediction that caters for models with a large number
of parameters and is robust to model misspecification. Given a class of high-dimensional (but parametric) 
predictive models, this new approach constructs a posterior predictive using a variational
approximation to a loss-based, or Gibbs, posterior that is directly focused on predictive accuracy.
The theoretical behavior of the new prediction approach is analyzed and a form of optimality demonstrated. 
Applications to both simulated and empirical data using high-dimensional Bayesian neural
network and autoregressive mixture models demonstrate that the approach provides more accurate
results than various alternatives, including misspecified likelihood-based predictions

Keywords: three-dimensional panel data, bilateral trade, asymptotic theory
Abstract: This study decomposes the bilateral trade flows using a three-dimensional panel
data model. Under the scenario that all three dimensions diverge to infinity, we propose 
an estimation approach to identify the number of global shocks and countryspecific shocks 
sequentially, and establish the asymptotic theories accordingly. From
the practical point of view, being able to separate the pervasive and nonpervasive
shocks in a multi-dimensional panel data is crucial for a range of applications, such
as, international financial linkages, migration flows, etc. In the numerical studies,
we first conduct intensive simulations to examine the theoretical findings, and then
use the proposed approach to investigate the international trade flows from two
major trading groups (APEC and EU) over 1982-2019, and quantify the network
of bilateral trade.

Keywords: gross domestic product, high dimensional data, industrial production, 
macroeconomic forecasting, panel data
Abstract: We develop a method for constructing prediction intervals for a nonstationary
variable, such as GDP. The method uses a factor augmented regression [FAR] model.
The predictors in the model includes a small number of factors generated to extract
most of the information in a set of panel data on a large number of macroeconomic
variables considered to be potential predictors. The novelty of this paper is that it
provides a method and justification for a mixture of stationary and nonstationary 
factors as predictors in the FAR model; we refer to this as mixture-FAR method. This
method is important because typically such a large set of panel data, for example
the FRED-MD, is likely to contain a mixture of stationary and nonstationary variables. 
In our simulation study, we observed that the proposed mixture-FAR method
performed better than its competitor that requires all the predictors to be nonstationary; 
the MSE of prediction was at least 33% lower for mixture-FAR. Using the data
in FRED-QD for the US, we evaluated the aforementioned methods for forecasting
the nonstationary variables, GDP and Industrial Production. We observed that the
mixture-FAR method performed better than its competitors.

Keywords: concentrated quasi-maximum likelihood estimation, local linear estimation, time-varying coefficient
Abstract: This paper considers a semiparametric spatial autoregressive panel data model with fixed
effects with time-varying coefficients. The time-varying coefficients are allowed to follow an
unknown function of time while the other parameters are assumed to be constants. We propose
a "local linear concentrated quasi-maximum likelihood estimation" method to obtain consistent 
estimators for the spatial autoregressive coefficient, the variance of the error term and
the nonparametric time-varying coefficients. We show that the estimators of the parametric
components converge at the rate of sqrt(NT), and those of the nonparametric time-varying 
coefficients converge at the rate of sqrt(NTh). Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to 
illustrate the finite sample performance of our proposed method. We apply our method to 
study the spatial influences and the time-varying spillover effects in the wage level 
among 159 Chinese cities.

Keywords: business cycle, financial cycle, financial shocks 
Abstract: We jointly estimate the U.S. business and financial cycle through a unified empirical
approach while simultaneously accounting for the role of financial factors. Our approach
uses the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition within a medium-scale Bayesian Vector Autoregression. 
First, we show, both in reduced form and when we identify a structural financial
shock, that variation in financial factors had a larger role post-2000 and a more modest
role pre-2000. Our results suggest that the financial sector did play a role in overheating
the business cycle pre-Great Recession. Second, while we document a positive unconditional 
correlation between the credit cycle and the output gap, the correlation of the
lagged credit cycle and the contemporaneous output gap turns negative when we condition
on a financial shock. The sign-switch suggests that the nature of the underlying shocks
may be important for understanding the relationship between the business and financial
cycles.

distance, smart meter data 
Abstract: Manifold learning algorithms are valuable tools for the analysis of high-dimensional data, 
many of which include a step where nearest neighbors of all observations are found. This can present a
computational bottleneck when the number of observations is large or when the observations lie
in more general metric spaces, such as statistical manifolds, which require all pairwise distances
between observations to be computed. We resolve this problem by using a broad range of approximate 
nearest neighbor algorithms within manifold learing algorithms and evaluating their impact
on embedding accuracy. We use approximate nearest neighbors for statistical maifolds by exploiting
the connection between Hellinger/Total variation distance for discrete distributions and the L2/L1
norm. Via a thorough empirical investigation based on the benchmark MNIST dataset, it is shown
that approximate nearest neighbors lead to substantial improvements in computational time with
little to no loss in the accuracy of the embedding produced by a manifold learning algorithm. This
result is robust to the use of different manifold learning algorithms, to the use of different 
approximate nearest neighbor algorithms, and to the use of different measures of embedding accuracy.
The proposed method is applied to learning statistical manifolds data on distributions of electricity
usage. This application demonstrates how the proposed methods can be used to visualize and
identify anomalies and uncover underlying structure within high-dimensional data in a way that is
scalable to large datasets.

Keywords: anomaly detection, topological data analysis, persistent homology, extreme value
theory, peak over thresholds, generalized Pareto distribution 
Abstract: This paper introduces lookout, a new approach to detect outliers using leave-one-out kernel
density estimates and extreme value theory. Outlier detection methods that use kernel density
estimates generally employ a user defined parameter to determine the bandwidth. Lookout
uses persistent homology to construct a bandwidth suitable for outlier detection without any
user input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of lookout on an extensive data repository by
comparing its performance with other outlier detection methods based on extreme value theory.
Furthermore, we introduce outlier persistence, a useful concept that explores the birth and the
cessation of outliers with changing bandwidth and significance levels. The R package lookout
implements this algorithm.

Abstract: COVID-19 has had a devastating effect on many industries around the world including tourism, and policy makers
are interested in mapping out what the recovery path will look like. In this paper we focus on Australian tourism, 
analysing international arrivals and domestic flows. Both sectors have been severely affected by travel restrictions 
in the form of international and interstate border closures and regional lockdowns. We use statistical models
of historical data to generate COVID-free counterfactual forecasts pretending that the pandemic never occurred. We 
also use survey responses from 443 tourism experts to generate scenario-based probabilistic forecasts for pessimistic, 
most-likely and optimistic paths to recovery. Using both sets of forecasts, we estimate the expected effect of the 
pandemic on the Australian tourism industry.
