Keywords: multivariate dynamic time series, time-varying impulse response, testing for parameter stability
Abstract: This paper proposes a class of parametric multiple-index time series models that involve
linear combinations of time trends, stationary variables and unit root processes as regressors.
The inclusion of the three different types of time series, along with the use of a multiple-index
structure for these variables to circumvent the curse of dimensionality, is due to both theoretical
and practical considerations. The M-type estimators (including OLS, LAD, Huberâ€™s estimator,
quantile and expectile estimators, etc.) for the index vectors are proposed, and their asymptotic
properties are established, with the aid of the generalized function approach to accommodate
a wide class of loss functions that may not be necessarily differentiable at every point. The
proposed multiple-index model is then applied to study the stock return predictability, which
reveals strong nonlinear predictability under various loss measures. Monte Carlo simulations
are also included to evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed estimators.

Keywords: multivariate dynamic time series, time-varying impulse response, testing for parameter stability
Abstract: Vector autoregressive (VAR) models are widely used in practical studies, e.g., forecasting,
modelling policy transmission mechanism, and measuring connection of economic agents. To
better capture the dynamics, this paper introduces a new class of time-varying VAR models
in which the coefficients and covariance matrix of the error innovations are allowed to change
smoothly over time. Accordingly, we establish a set of theories, including the impulse responses
analyses subject to both of the short-run timing and the long-run restrictions, an information
criterion to select the optimal lag, and a Wald-type test to determine the constant coefficients.
Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the theoretical findings. Finally, we demonstrate
the empirical relevance and usefulness of the proposed methods through an application to the
transmission mechanism of U.S. monetary policy.

Keywords: growth regressions, convergence in manufacturing, cross-sectional dependence, hierarchical model, 
asymptotic theory
Abstract: Despite its paramount importance in the empirical growth literature, productivity convergence analysis
has three problems that have yet to be resolved: (1) little attempt has been made to explore the hierarchical 
structure of industry-level datasets; (2) industry-level technology heterogeneity has largely been ignored; and
(3) cross-sectional dependence has rarely been allowed for. This paper aims to address these three problems 
within a hierarchical panel data framework. We propose an estimation procedure and then derive the corresponding 
asymptotic theory. Finally, we apply the framework to a dataset of 23 manufacturing industries from a wide range 
of countries over the period 1963-2018. Our results show that both the manufacturing industry as a whole and 
individual manufacturing industries at the ISIC two-digit level exhibit strong conditional convergence in 
labour productivity, but not unconditional convergence. In addition, our results show that both global and 
industry-specific shocks are important in explaining the convergence behaviours of the manufacturing industries.

Abstract: This paper proposes using Chebyshev polynomials to approximate time-varying parameters
of a GARCH model, where polynomial coefficients are estimated via numerical optimization
using the function gradient descent method. We investigate the asymptotic properties of the
estimates of polynomial coefficients and the subsequent estimate of conditional variance.
Monte Carlo studies are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed polynomial
approximation. With empirical studies of modelling daily returns of the US 30-year T-bond
daily closing price and daily returns of the gold futures closing price, we find that in terms of
in-sample fitting and out-of-sample forecasting, our proposed time-varying model outperforms 
the constant-parameter counterpart and a benchmark time-varying model.

Abstract: Educational achievement distributions for Australian indigenous and nonindigenous populations in the
years 2001, 2006, 2014 and 2017 are considered. Bayesian inference is used to analyse how these
ordinal categorical distributions have changed over time and to compare indigenous and nonindigenous
distributions. Both the level of educational achievement and inequality in educational achievement are
considered. To compare changes in levels over time, as well as inequality between the two populations,
first order stochastic dominance and an index of educational poverty are used. To examine changes in
inequality over time, two inequality indices and generalised Lorenz dominance are considered. Results
are presented in terms of posterior densities for the indices and posterior probabilities for dominance
for the dominance comparisons. We find some evidence of improvement over time, especially in the
lower parts of the indigenous distribution and that inequality has significantly increased from 2001 to
2017.

Abstract: Bayesian nonparametric estimates of Australian mental health distributions are obtained to 
assess how the mental health status of the population has changed over time, and to compare the 
mental health status of female/male and indigenous/non-indigenous population subgroups. First-order 
and secondorder stochastic dominance are used to compare distributions, with results presented in 
terms of the posterior probability of dominance and the posterior probability of no dominance. If a 
criterion for dominance is satisfied, then, in terms of that criterion, the mental health status of 
the dominant population is superior to that of the dominated population. If neither distribution is 
dominant, then the mental health status of neither population is superior in the same sense. Our 
results suggest mental health has deteriorated in recent years, that males' mental health status 
is better than that of females, and that non-indigenous health status is better than that of the 
indigenous population.

Keywords: multivariate time series, parameter instability, specification testing, time-varying coefficient
Abstract: Multivariate dynamic models are widely used in practical studies providing a tractable
way to capture evolving interrelationships among multivariate time series, but not many studies 
focus on inferences. Along this line, a key question is that whether some coefficients (if
not all) evolve with time. To settle this issue, the paper develops a Wald-type test statistic
for detecting time-invariant parameters in a class of multivariate dynamic time-varying models. 
Since Gaussian/stationary approximation methods initially proposed for univariate time
series settings are inapplicable to the setting under consideration in this paper, we develop
an approximation method using a time-varying vector moving average infinity process. We
show that the test statistic is asymptotically normal under both the null hypothesis and the
local alternative. Simulation studies show that the proposed test has a desirable finite sample
performance.

new challenges stemming from both the structure of the hierarchy and the
application context. We discuss several relevant dimensions for researchers
and analysts: the scale and units of the time series, the issue of sparsity,
the forecast horizon, the importance of multiple evaluation windows and the
multiple objective decision context. We conclude with a series of practical
recommendations.

Abstract: This paper examines how the price of home heating affects mortality in the US.
Exposure to cold is one of the reasons that mortality peaks in winter, and a higher
heating price increases exposure to cold by reducing heating use. In addition, a higher
price raises energy bills, which could also affect health by decreasing other healthpromoting 
spending. Our empirical approach combines spatial variation in the energy
source used for home heating and temporal variation in the national prices of natural
gas and electricity. We find that a lower heating price reduces winter mortality, driven
mostly by cardiovascular and respiratory causes. The effect is especially large in 
highpoverty communities.

Abstract: We propose a new method for Bayesian prediction that caters for models with a large number
of parameters and is robust to model misspecification. Given a class of high-dimensional (but parametric) 
predictive models, this new approach constructs a posterior predictive using a variational
approximation to a loss-based, or Gibbs, posterior that is directly focused on predictive accuracy.
The theoretical behavior of the new prediction approach is analyzed and a form of optimality demonstrated. 
Applications to both simulated and empirical data using high-dimensional Bayesian neural
network and autoregressive mixture models demonstrate that the approach provides more accurate
results than various alternatives, including misspecified likelihood-based predictions

Keywords: three-dimensional panel data, bilateral trade, asymptotic theory
Abstract: This study decomposes the bilateral trade flows using a three-dimensional panel
data model. Under the scenario that all three dimensions diverge to infinity, we propose 
an estimation approach to identify the number of global shocks and countryspecific shocks 
sequentially, and establish the asymptotic theories accordingly. From
the practical point of view, being able to separate the pervasive and nonpervasive
shocks in a multi-dimensional panel data is crucial for a range of applications, such
as, international financial linkages, migration flows, etc. In the numerical studies,
we first conduct intensive simulations to examine the theoretical findings, and then
use the proposed approach to investigate the international trade flows from two
major trading groups (APEC and EU) over 1982-2019, and quantify the network
of bilateral trade.

Keywords: gross domestic product, high dimensional data, industrial production, 
macroeconomic forecasting, panel data
Abstract: We develop a method for constructing prediction intervals for a nonstationary
variable, such as GDP. The method uses a factor augmented regression [FAR] model.
The predictors in the model includes a small number of factors generated to extract
most of the information in a set of panel data on a large number of macroeconomic
variables considered to be potential predictors. The novelty of this paper is that it
provides a method and justification for a mixture of stationary and nonstationary 
factors as predictors in the FAR model; we refer to this as mixture-FAR method. This
method is important because typically such a large set of panel data, for example
the FRED-MD, is likely to contain a mixture of stationary and nonstationary variables. 
In our simulation study, we observed that the proposed mixture-FAR method
performed better than its competitor that requires all the predictors to be nonstationary; 
the MSE of prediction was at least 33% lower for mixture-FAR. Using the data
in FRED-QD for the US, we evaluated the aforementioned methods for forecasting
the nonstationary variables, GDP and Industrial Production. We observed that the
mixture-FAR method performed better than its competitors.

Abstract: This paper considers a semiparametric spatial autoregressive panel data model with fixed
effects with time-varying coefficients. The time-varying coefficients are allowed to follow an
unknown function of time while the other parameters are assumed to be constants. We propose
a "local linear concentrated quasi-maximum likelihood estimation" method to obtain consistent 
estimators for the spatial autoregressive coefficient, the variance of the error term and
the nonparametric time-varying coefficients. We show that the estimators of the parametric
components converge at the rate of sqrt(NT), and those of the nonparametric time-varying 
coefficients converge at the rate of sqrt(NTh). Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to 
illustrate the finite sample performance of our proposed method. We apply our method to 
study the spatial influences and the time-varying spillover effects in the wage level 
among 159 Chinese cities.

Keywords: business cycle, financial cycle, financial shocks 
Abstract: We jointly estimate the U.S. business and financial cycle through a unified empirical
approach while simultaneously accounting for the role of financial factors. Our approach
uses the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition within a medium-scale Bayesian Vector Autoregression. 
First, we show, both in reduced form and when we identify a structural financial
shock, that variation in financial factors had a larger role post-2000 and a more modest
role pre-2000. Our results suggest that the financial sector did play a role in overheating
the business cycle pre-Great Recession. Second, while we document a positive unconditional 
correlation between the credit cycle and the output gap, the correlation of the
lagged credit cycle and the contemporaneous output gap turns negative when we condition
on a financial shock. The sign-switch suggests that the nature of the underlying shocks
may be important for understanding the relationship between the business and financial
cycles.

Abstract: Manifold learning algorithms are valuable tools for the analysis of high-dimensional data, 
many of which include a step where nearest neighbors of all observations are found. This can present a
computational bottleneck when the number of observations is large or when the observations lie
in more general metric spaces, such as statistical manifolds, which require all pairwise distances
between observations to be computed. We resolve this problem by using a broad range of approximate 
nearest neighbor algorithms within manifold learing algorithms and evaluating their impact
on embedding accuracy. We use approximate nearest neighbors for statistical maifolds by exploiting
the connection between Hellinger/Total variation distance for discrete distributions and the L2/L1
norm. Via a thorough empirical investigation based on the benchmark MNIST dataset, it is shown
that approximate nearest neighbors lead to substantial improvements in computational time with
little to no loss in the accuracy of the embedding produced by a manifold learning algorithm. This
result is robust to the use of different manifold learning algorithms, to the use of different 
approximate nearest neighbor algorithms, and to the use of different measures of embedding accuracy.
The proposed method is applied to learning statistical manifolds data on distributions of electricity
usage. This application demonstrates how the proposed methods can be used to visualize and
identify anomalies and uncover underlying structure within high-dimensional data in a way that is
scalable to large datasets.

Abstract: This paper introduces lookout, a new approach to detect outliers using leave-one-out kernel
density estimates and extreme value theory. Outlier detection methods that use kernel density
estimates generally employ a user defined parameter to determine the bandwidth. Lookout
uses persistent homology to construct a bandwidth suitable for outlier detection without any
user input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of lookout on an extensive data repository by
comparing its performance with other outlier detection methods based on extreme value theory.
Furthermore, we introduce outlier persistence, a useful concept that explores the birth and the
cessation of outliers with changing bandwidth and significance levels. The R package lookout
implements this algorithm.

Abstract: COVID-19 has had a devastating effect on many industries around the world including tourism, and policy makers
are interested in mapping out what the recovery path will look like. In this paper we focus on Australian tourism, 
analysing international arrivals and domestic flows. Both sectors have been severely affected by travel restrictions 
in the form of international and interstate border closures and regional lockdowns. We use statistical models
of historical data to generate COVID-free counterfactual forecasts pretending that the pandemic never occurred. We 
also use survey responses from 443 tourism experts to generate scenario-based probabilistic forecasts for pessimistic, 
most-likely and optimistic paths to recovery. Using both sets of forecasts, we estimate the expected effect of the 
pandemic on the Australian tourism industry.
