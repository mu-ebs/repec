Abstract: Key to ensuring a successful tourism sector is timely policy making and detailed planning.
National policy formulation and strategic planning requires long-term forecasts
at an aggregate level, while regional operational decisions require short-term forecasts,
relevant to local tourism operators. For aligned decisions at all levels, supporting forecasts
must be `coherent', that is they should add up appropriately, across relevant
demarcations (e.g., geographical divisions or market segments) and also across time.
We propose an approach for generating coherent forecasts across both cross-sections
and planning horizons for Australia. This results in significant improvements in forecast
accuracy with substantial decision making benefits. Coherent forecasts help break
intra- and inter-organisational information and planning silos, in a data driven fashion,
blending information from different sources.

Keywords: generalized method of moments, high dimensional models, moment restriction, over-identification, penalization, sieve method, sparsity.
Abstract: We consider nonlinear moment restriction semiparametric models where both the
dimension of the parameter vector and the number of restrictions are divergent with
sample size and an unknown smooth function is involved. We propose an estimation
method based on the sieve generalized method of moments (sieve-GMM). We establish
consistency and asymptotic normality for the estimated quantities when the number
of parameters increases modestly with sample size. We also consider the case where
the number of potential parameters/covariates is very large, i.e., increases rapidly with
sample size, but the true model exhibits sparsity. We use a penalized sieve GMM approach
to select the relevant variables, and establish the oracle property of our method
in this case. We also provide new results for inference. We propose several new test
statistics for the over-identification and establish their large sample properties. We provide
a simulation study and an application to data from the NLSY79 used by Carneiro
et al. [14].

Abstract: Income elasticity dynamics of health expenditure is considered for the OECD and the
Eurozone over the period 1995-2014. This paper studies a novel non-linear cointegration
model with fixed effects, controlling for cross-section dependence and unobserved heterogeneity.
Most importantly, its coefficients can vary over time and its variables can be
non-stationary. The resulting asymptotic theory is fundamentally different with a faster
rate of convergence to similar kernel smoothing methodologies. A fully modified kernel
regression method is also proposed to reduce the asymptotic bias. Results show a steep
increase in the income elasticity for the OECD and a small increase for the Eurozone.

conditional maximization algorithm to estimate the unknown parameters. Simulation results show
that the algorithm works well in finite samples. The biases of the maximum likelihood estimators
are negligible and the root mean squared errors of the maximum likelihood estimators decrease with
the increase of either cross-sectional units N or time periods T.

Abstract: In this paper, we study intra-city agglomeration externality and inter-city spillover effects
on productivity of 185 Chinese cities at and above the prefectural level for the years between
1995 and 2009. In particular, we investigate how a shock may be amplified or weakened
by these externality effects and how productivity in a city varies with and affects that of
other cities in the economy. We estimate the impacts of population size on productivity in
185 Chinese cities using spatial fixed-effect panel data models. Both the endogenous and
exogenous spatial dependence are allowed for. The direct and indirect effects of the factors
are calculated and compared for various city groups. We find that a significant positive effect
of urban population on the real wage levels, which confirms the existence of agglomeration
economy within regions. We also find significant differences in both the direct and indirect
effect of factors such as FDI between more and less population dense areas. This seems to
suggest that agglomeration economy may also exist among regions. Disparity between regions
in economic growth and productivity could be explained by the statistically significant regional
variations in the direct and indirect effects.

Abstract: We propose an automated method for obtaining weighted forecast combinations using time
series features. The proposed approach involves two phases. First, we use a collection of time
series to train a meta-model to assign weights to various possible forecasting methods with the
goal of minimizing the average forecasting loss obtained from a weighted forecast combination.
The inputs to the meta-model are features extracted from each series. In the second phase, we
forecast new series using a weighted forecast combination where the weights are obtained from
our previously trained meta-model. Our method outperforms a simple forecast combination,
and outperforms all of the most popular individual methods in the time series forecasting
literature. The approach achieved second position in the M4 competition.

Keywords: long memory models, pseudo-true parameter, frequency domain estimators, time domain estimators, Whittle, conditional sum of squares.
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive set of new results on the impact of mis-specifying the
short run dynamics in fractionally integrated processes. We show that four alternative
parametric estimators - frequency domain maximum likelihood, Whittle, time domain
maximum likelihood and conditional sum of squares - converge to the same pseudo-true
value under common mis-specification, and that they possess a common asymptotic distribution.
The results are derived assuming a completely general parametric specification
for the short run dynamics of the estimated (mis-specified) fractional model, and with
long memory, short memory and antipersistence in both the model and the true data
generating process accommodated. As well as providing new theoretical insights, we
undertake an extensive set of numerical explorations, beginning with the numerical evaluation,
and implementation, of the (common) asymptotic distribution that holds under
the most extreme form of mis-specification. Simulation experiments are then conducted
to assess the relative finite sample performance of all four mis-specified estimators, initially
under the assumption of a known mean, as accords with the theoretical derivations.
The importance of the known mean assumption is illustrated via the production of an
alternative set of bias and mean squared error results, in which the estimators are applied
to demeaned data. The paper concludes with a discussion of open problems.

Abstract: This paper provides an extensive evaluation of high frequency jump tests and measures, in
the context of using such tests and measures in the estimation of dynamic models for asset price
jumps. Specifically, we investigate: i) the power of alternative tests to detect individual price
jumps, most notably in the presence of volatility jumps; ii) the frequency with which sequences
of dynamic jumps are correctly identified; iii) the accuracy with which the magnitude and sign
of a sequence of jumps, including small clusters of consecutive jumps, are estimated; and iv) the
robustness of inference about dynamic jumps to test and measure design. Substantial differences
are discerned in the performance of alternative methods in certain dimensions, with inference
being sensitive to these differences in some cases. Accounting for measurement error when
using measures constructed from high frequency data to conduct inference on dynamic jump
models is also shown to have an impact. The sensitivity of inference to test and measurement
construction is documented using both artificially generated data and empirical data on both
the S&P500 stock index and the IBM stock price. The paper concludes by providing guidelines
for empirical researchers who wish to exploit high frequency data when drawing conclusions
regarding dynamic jump processes.

Recasting the challenge of understanding these dependencies as an algorithm selection problem, we perform

and weaknesses of unsupervised outlier detection methods to be visualized and insights gained into
which method and normalization scheme should be selected to obtain the most likely best performance
for a given dataset.

Abstract: The explosion of time series data in recent years has brought a flourish of new time series analysis
methods, for forecasting, clustering, classification and other tasks. The evaluation of these new
methods requires a diverse collection of time series data to enable reliable comparisons against
alternative approaches. We propose the use of mixture autoregressive (MAR) models to generate
collections of time series with diverse features. We simulate sets of time series using MAR
models and investigate the diversity and coverage of the simulated time series in a feature space.
An efficient method is also proposed for generating new time series with controllable features
by tuning the parameters of the MAR models. The simulated data based on our method can be
used as evaluation tool for tasks such as time series classification and forecasting.

principles, with a goal to integrating missing value handling as an integral part of data analysis
workflows. New data structures are defined along with new functions (verbs) to perform
common operations. Together these provide a cohesive framework for handling, exploring, and
imputing missing values. These methods have been made available in the R package naniar.

Abstract: In this paper we focus on estimating the degree of cross-sectional dependence in the error terms of a classical panel data regression model. 
For this purpose we propose an estimator of the exponent of cross-sectional dependence denoted by alpha, which is based on the number of non-zero pair-wise 
cross correlations of these errors. We prove that our estimator, tilde(alpha), is consistent and derive the rate at which tilde(alpha) approaches its true value.
We evaluate the finite sample properties of the proposed estimator by use of a Monte Carlo simulation study. The numerical results are encouraging and 
supportive of the theoretical findings. Finally, we undertake an empirical investigation of alpha for the errors of the CAPM model and its Fama-French 
extensions using 10-year rolling samples from S&P 500 securities over the period Sept 1989 - May 2018.

Abstract: In risk management areas such as reinsurance, the need often arises to construct a
confidence interval for a quantile in the tail of the distribution. While different methods
are available for this purpose, doubts have been raised about the validity of full-sample
bootstrap. In this paper, we first obtain some general results on the validity of fullsample
bootstrap for the tail quantile process. This opens the possibility of developing
bootstrap methods based on tail statistics. Second, we develop a bootstrap method
for constructing confidence intervals for high-quantiles of heavy-tailed distributions and
show that it is consistent. In our simulation study, the bootstrap method for constructing
confidence intervals for high quantiles performed overall better than the data
tilting method, but none was uniformly the best; the data tilting method appears to
be currently the preferred choice. Since the two methods are based on quite different
approaches, we recommend that both methods be used side by side in applications.

Abstract: Forecast reconciliation involves adjusting forecasts to ensure coherence with aggregation constraints.
We extend this concept from point forecasts to probabilistic forecasts by redefining
forecast reconciliation in terms of linear functions in general, and projections more specifically.
New theorems establish that the true predictive distribution can be recovered in the elliptical
case by linear reconciliation, and general conditions are derived for when this is a projection. A
geometric interpretation is also used to prove two new theoretical results for point forecasting;
that reconciliation via projection both preserves unbiasedness and dominates unreconciled
forecasts in a mean squared error sense. Strategies for forecast evaluation based on scoring rules
are discussed, and it is shown that the popular log score is an improper scoring rule with respect
to the class of unreconciled forecasts when the true predictive distribution coheres with aggregation
constraints. Finally, evidence from a simulation study shows that reconciliation based
on an oblique projection, derived from the MinT method of Wickramasuriya, Athanasopoulos
and Hyndman (2018) for point forecasting, outperforms both reconciled and unreconciled
alternatives.

Abstract: We study the behaviour of the Betfair betting market and the sterling/dollar exchange rate (futures price) during 24 June 2016, the
night of the EU referendum. We investigate how the two markets responded to the announcement of the voting results. We employ a
Bayesian updating methodology to update prior opinion about the likelihood of the final outcome of the vote. We then relate the voting
model to the real time evolution of the market determined prices as results are announced. We find that although both markets appear
to be inefficient in absorbing the new information contained in vote outcomes, the betting market is apparently less inefficient than the
FX market. The different rates of convergence to fundamental value between the two markets leads to highly profitable arbitrage opportunities.

model), which includes the endogenous regime switching model by Chang et al. (2017), the CCP
model, as a special case. To estimate the unknown parameters involved in the SERS model, we
propose a maximum likelihood estimation method. Monte Carlo simulation results show that
in the absence of state-varying endogeneity, the SERS model and the CCP model have similar
performance, while in the presence of state-varying endogeneity, the SERS model performs much
better than the CCP model. Finally, we use the SERS model to analyze the China stock market
returns and our empirical results show that there exists strongly state-varying endogeneity in
volatility switching for the Shanghai Composite Index returns. Moreover, the SERS model can
indeed produce a much more realistic assessment for the regime switching process than the one
obtained by the CCP model.

Keywords: Extended generalized partially linear single-index, control function approach, endogeneity,
semiparametric regression models.
Abstract: In this paper, the important (but so far unrevealed) usefulness of the extended generalized partially
linear single-index (EGPLSI) model introduced by Xia et al. (1999) in its ability to model a
flexible shape-invariant specification is elaborated. More importantly, a control function approach
is proposed to address the potential endogeneity problems in the EGPLSI model in order to enhance
its applicability to empirical studies. In the process, it is shown that the attractive asymptotic
features of the single-index type of a semiparametric model are still valid in our proposed estimation
procedure given intrinsic generated covariates. Our newly developed method is then applied to
address the endogeneity of expenditure in the semiparametric analysis of a system of empirical
Engel curves by using the British data, highlights the convenient applicability of our proposed
method.

Abstract: We find that factors explaining bank loan recovery rates vary depending on the state of the economic
cycle. Our modeling approach incorporates a two-state Markov switching mechanism as a proxy
for the latent credit cycle, helping to explain differences in observed recovery rates over time. Using US
bank default loan data from Moody's Ultimate Recovery Database and covering the pre- and post-GFC
period, this paper develops a dynamic predictive model for bank loan recovery rates, accommodating
the distinctive empirical features of the recovery rate data while incorporating a large number
of possible determinants. We find that the probability of default and certain loan-specific and other
variables hold different explanatory power with respect to recovery rates over `good' and `bad' times in
the credit cycle, meaning that the relationship between recovery rates and certain loan characteristics,
firm characteristics and the probability of default differs depending on underlying credit market conditions.
Our findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for countercyclical expected recovery
rates when determining capital retention levels.

Abstract: A crucial task in time series forecasting is the identification of the most suitable forecasting
method. We present a general framework for forecast-model selection using meta-learning. A
random forest is used to identify the best forecasting method using only time series features.
The framework is evaluated using time series from the M1 and M3 competitions and is
shown to yield accurate forecasts comparable to several benchmarks and other commonly
used automated approaches of time series forecasting. A key advantage of our proposed
framework is that the time-consuming process of building a classifier is handled in advance
of the forecasting task at hand.

Keywords: asymptotic theory, closed-form estimation, cross-sectional model, Hermite series expansion.
Abstract: This paper discusses a semiparametric single-index model. The link function is allowed
to be unbounded and has unbounded support that fill the gap in the literature. The link
function is treated as a point in an infinitely many dimensional function space which enables
us to derive the estimates for the index parameter and the link function simultaneously.
This approach is different from the profile method commonly used in the literature. The
estimator is derived from an optimization with the constraint of an identification condition
for the index parameter, which solves an important problem in the literature of single-index
models.

In addition, making use of a property of Hermite orthogonal polynomials, an explicit
estimator for the index parameter is obtained. Asymptotic properties of the two estimators
of the index parameter are established. Their efficiency is discussed in some special cases
as well. The finite sample properties of the two estimators are demonstrated through an
extensive Monte Carlo study and an empirical example.

Keywords: concept drift, extreme value theory, feature-based time series analysis, kernel-based density estimation, multivariate time series, outlier detection.
Abstract: This article proposes a framework that provides early detection of anomalous series within a large
collection of non-stationary streaming time series data. We define an anomaly as an observation that is
very unlikely given the recent distribution of a given system. The proposed framework first forecasts a
boundary for the system's typical behavior using extreme value theory. Then a sliding window is used to
test for anomalous series within a newly arrived collection of series. The model uses time series features as
inputs, and a density-based comparison to detect any significant changes in the distribution of the features.
Using various synthetic and real world datasets, we demonstrate the wide applicability and usefulness of
our proposed framework. We show that the proposed algorithm can work well in the presence of noisy
non-stationarity data within multiple classes of time series. This framework is implemented in the open
source R package oddstream. R code and data are available in the supplementary materials.

Keywords: change-point, segmented regressions, break dates, hypothesis testing, multiple equations systems.
Abstract: The issue addressed in this paper is that of testing for common breaks across or
within equations of a multivariate system. Our framework is very general and allows
integrated regressors and trends as well as stationary regressors. The null hypothesis
is that breaks in different parameters occur at common locations and are separated
by some positive fraction of the sample size unless they occur across different equations.
Under the alternative hypothesis, the break dates across parameters are not the
same and also need not be separated by a positive fraction of the sample size whether
within or across equations. The test considered is the quasi-likelihood ratio test assuming
normal errors, though as usual the limit distribution of the test remains valid
with non-normal errors. Of independent interest, we provide results about the rate of
convergence of the estimates when searching over all possible partitions subject only
to the requirement that each regime contains at least as many observations as some
positive fraction of the sample size, allowing break dates not separated by a positive
fraction of the sample size across equations. Simulations show that the test has good
finite sample properties. We also provide an application to issues related to level shifts
and persistence for various measures of inflation to illustrate its usefulness.

Keywords: Bayesian prediction, likelihood-free methods, predictive merging, proper scoring rules, particle filtering, jump-diffusion models.
Abstract: Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) has become increasingly prominent as
a method for conducting parameter inference in a range of challenging statistical problems,
most notably those characterized by an intractable likelihood function. In this
paper, we focus on the use of ABC not as a tool for parametric inference, but as a
means of generating probabilistic forecasts; or for conducting what we refer to as "approximate
Bayesian forecasting". The four key issues explored are: i) the link between
the theoretical behavior of the ABC posterior and that of the ABC-based predictive;
ii) the use of proper scoring rules to measure the (potential) loss of forecast accuracy
when using an approximate rather than an exact predictive; iii) the performance of
approximate Bayesian forecasting in state space models; and iv) the use of forecast
accuracy to inform the selection of ABC summaries in empirical settings. The primary
finding of the paper is that ABC can provide a computationally ecient
means of generating probabilistic forecasts that are nearly identical to those produced by the exact
predictive, and in a fraction of the time required to produce predictions via an exact
method.

Keywords: asymptotic theory, orthogonal series method, translog cost function, return to scale.
Abstract: In this paper, we study a varying-coefficient panel data model with nonstationarity,
wherein a factor structure is adopted to capture different effects of time invariant variables
over time. The methodology employed in this paper fills a gap of dealing with the mixed
I(1)/I(0) regressors and factors in the literature. For comparison purposes, we consider the
scenarios where the factors are either observable or unobservable, respectively. We propose
an estimation method for both the unknown coefficient functions involved and the unknown
factors before we establish the corresponding theory. We then evaluate the finite-sample
performance of the proposed estimation theory through extensive Monte Carlo simulations.
In an empirical study, we use our newly proposed model and method to study the returns
to scale of large commercial banks in the U.S.. Some overlooked modelling issues in the
literature of production econometrics are addressed.
