Title: Assessing the Magnitude of the Concentration Parameter in a Simultaneous Equations Model

Keywords: Concentration parameter, simultaneous equations model, alienation coefficient, Wilks-lambda distribution, admissible invariant test.
Abstract: Poskitt and Skeels (2003) provide a new approximation to the sampling distribution of the IV estimator in a simultaneous equations model. This approximation is appropriate when the concentration parameter associated with the reduced form model is small and a basic purpose of this paper is to provide the practitioner with a method of ascertaining when the concentration parameter is small, and hence when the use of the Poskitt and Skeels (2003) approximation is appropriate. Existing procedures tend to focus on the notion of correlation and hypothesis testing.  Approaching the problem from a different perspective leads us to advocate a different statistic for use in this problem. We provide exact and approximate distribution theory for the proposed statistic and show that it satisfies various optimality criteria not satisfied by some of its competitors. Rather than adopting a testing approach we suggest the use of p-values as a calibration device.

Keywords: Exponential smoothing; Holt-Winters; Seasonality; Structural time series model
Abstract: A new approach is proposed for forecasting a time series with multiple seasonal patterns. A state space model is developed for the series using the single source of error approach which enables us to develop explicit models for both additive and multiplicative seasonality. Parameter estimates may be obtained using methods adapted from general exponential smoothing, although the Kalman filter may also be used. The proposed model is used to examine hourly and daily patterns in hourly data for both utility loads and traffic flows. Our formulation provides a model for several existing seasonal methods and also provides new options, which result in superior forecasting performance over a range of prediction horizons. The approach is likely to be useful in a wide range of applications involving both high and low frequency data, and it handles missing values in a straightforward manner.

Abstract: In important conflicts, people typically rely on experts' judgments to predict the decisions that adversaries will make. We compared the accuracy of 106 expert and 169 novice forecasts for eight real conflicts. The forecasts of experts using unaided judgment were little better than those of novices, and neither were much better than simply guessing. The forecasts of experts with more experience were no more accurate than those with less. Speculating that consideration of the relative frequency of decisions might improve accuracy, we obtained 89 forecasts from novices instructed to assume there were 100 similar situations and to ascribe frequencies to decisions. Their forecasts were no more accurate than 96 forecasts from novices asked to pick the most likely decision. We conclude that expert judgment should not be used for predicting decisions that people will make in conflicts. Their use might lead decision makers to overlook other, more useful, approaches.

Keywords: Leverage effect; Likelihood ratio test; Markov Chain Monte Carlo; Monte Carlo kernel likelihood; Particle filter
Abstract: This paper presents a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to estimate parameters and latent stochastic processes in the asymmetric stochastic volatility (SV) model, in which the Box-Cox transformation of the squared volatility follows an autoregressive Gaussian distribution and the marginal density of asset returns has heavytails.  To test for the significance of the Box-Cox transformation parameter, we present the likelihood ratio statistic, in which likelihood functions can be approximated using a particle filter and a Monte Carlo kernel likelihood. When applying the heavy-tailed asymmetric Box-Cox SV model and the proposed sampling algorithm to continuously compounded daily returns of the Australian stock index, we find significant empirical evidence supporting the Box-Cox transformation of the squared volatility against the alternative model involving a logarithmic transformation.

Keywords: Insurance Claims, Premiums, Tail-Index, Extreme Values
Abstract: Rapid growth in heavy-tailed claim severity in commercial liability insurance requires insurer response by way of flexible mechanisms to update premiums. To this end in this paper a new premium principle is established for heavy-tailed claims, and its properties investigated. Risk-neutral premiums for heavy-tailed claims are consistently and unbiasedly estimated by the ratio of the first two extremes of the claims distribution. That is, the heavy-tailed risk-neutral premium has a Pareto distribution with the same tail-index as the claims distribution. Insurers must predicate premiums on larger tail-index values, if solvency is to be maintained. Additionally, the structure of heavy-tailed premiums is shown to lead to a natural model for tail-index imprecision (demonstrably inescapable in the sample sizes with which we deal). Premiums which compensate for tail-index uncertainty preserve the ratio structure of risk-neutral premiums, but make a 'prudent' adjustment which reflects the insurer's risk-profile. An example using Swiss Re's (1999) major disaster data is used to illustrate application of the methodology to the largest claims in any insurance class.

Keywords: Investment rate, return on capital, panel data, fixed effects
Abstract: The paper extends the literature on financial development, inflation, and growth by using the idea that both the rates of return on physical and human capital affect growth. This leads to the introduction of the investment rate into the model, as a proxy for the return to physical capital, along with the inflation rate as a variable affecting the return to human capital. As a result financial development plays a different role from the typical growth-enhancing effect found pervasively in the literature. Instead the results suggest a new hypothesis linking financial development to the nature of the effect of inflation on growth.

Abstract: The paper presents panel data evidence for 13 transition countries on inflation, financial development and growth. It contributes to the growth literature by showing that the transition countries conform to developed country evidence in particular with the strong negative effect of inflation on growth. It also contributes more evidence to the debate on the role of financial development. Once inflation and the investment rate are included in the model, a key measure of financial development no longer has a positive effect on growth, as some recent literature has found.

Keywords: Forecast density evaluation, Non-constant parameters, Random walk
Abstract: This paper extends the family of smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) models by proposing a specification in which the autoregressive parameters follow random walks. The random walks in the parameters can capture structural change within a regime switching framework, but in contrast to the time varying STAR (TV-STAR) speciifcation recently introduced by Lundbergh et al (2003), structural change in our random walk STAR (RW-STAR) setting follows a stochastic process rather than a deterministic function of time. We suggest tests for RW-STAR behaviour and study the performance of RW-STARmodels in an empirical setting. The out-of sample forecasting performance of our RW-STAR models is encouraging - better than AR, LSTAR and TV-STAR specifications with respect to point forecasts and on a par with TV-STAR speciÞcations with respect to forecast density evaluations.

Abstract: A well known property of the Beveridge Nelson decomposition is that the innovations in the permanent and transitory components are perfectly correlated. We use a single source of error state space model to exploit this property and perform a Beveridge Nelson decomposition. The single source of error state space approach to the decomposition is computationally simple, and in contrast to other methods of performing the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition, it incorporates the direct estimation of the long-run multiplier.

Keywords: ARMAX, partially nonstationary, Kronecker index theory identification.
Abstract: This paper extends current theory on the identification and estimation of vector time series models to nonstationary processes. It examines the structure of dynamic simultaneous equations systems or ARMAX processes that start from a given set of initial conditions and evolve over a given, possibly infinite, future time horizon. The analysis proceeds by deriving the echelon canonical form for such processes. The results are obtained by amalgamating ideas from the theory of stochastic difference equations with adaptations of the Kronecker index theory of dynamic systems. An extension of these results to the analysis of unit-root, partially nonstationary (cointegrated) time series models is also presented, leading to straightforward identification conditions for the error correction, echelon canonical form. An innovations algorithm for the evaluation of the exact Gaussian likelihood is given and the asymptotic properties of the approximate Gaussian estimator and the exact maximum likelihood estimator based upon the algorithm are derived. Examples illustrating the theory are discussed and some experimental evidence is also presented.

Abstract: This paper presents a new approximation to the exact sampling distribution of the instrumental variables estimator in simultaneous equations models.  It differs from many of the approximations currently available, Edgeworth expansions for example, in that it is specifically designed to work well when the concentration parameter is small.  The approximation is remarkable for the simplicity of its final form, for its accuracy and for its ability to capture those stylized facts that characterize lack of identification and weak instrument scenarios.  The development leading to the approximation is also novel in that it introduces techniques of some independent interest not seen in this literature hitherto.

Keywords:  accuracy, conflict, forecasting, game theory, judgement, methods, role playing, simulated interaction. 
Abstract: If people in conflicts can more accurately forecast how others will respond, that should help them to make better decisions. Contrary to expert expectations, earlier research found game theorists' forecasts were less accurate than forecasts from simulated interactions using student role players. To assess whether the game theorists had been disadvantaged by the selection of conflicts, I obtained forecasts for three new conflicts (an escalating international confrontation, a takeover battle in the telecommunications industry, and a personal grievance dispute) of types preferred by game theory experts. As before, students were used as role-players, and others provided forecasts using their judgement. When averaged across eight conflicts including five from earlier research, 102 forecasts by 23 game theorists were no more accurate (31% correct predictions) than 357 forecasts by students who used their unaided judgement (32%). Sixty-two percent of 105 simulated-interaction forecasts were accurate, providing an average error reduction of 47% over game-theorist forecasts. Forecasts can sometimes have value without being strictly accurate. Assessing the forecasts using the alternative criterion of usefulness led to the same conclusions about the relative merits of the methods.

Keywords: accuracy, analogies, collaboration, conflict, expert, forecasting, judgment. 
Abstract: When people forecast, they often use analogies but in an unstructured manner. We propose a structured judgmental procedure that involves asking experts to list as many analogies as they can, rate how similar the analogies are to the target situation, and match the outcomes of the analogies with possible outcomes of the target. An administrator would then derive a forecast from the experts' information. We compared structured analogies with unaided judgments for predicting the decisions made in eight conflict situations. These were difficult forecasting problems; the 32% accuracy of the unaided experts was only slightly better than chance. In contrast, 46% of structured analogies forecasts were accurate. Among experts who were independently able to think of two or more analogies and who had direct experience with their closest analogy, 60% of forecasts were accurate. Collaboration did not improve accuracy.

Abstract: This paper investigates association between portfolio returns and higher-order systematic co-moments at different timescales obtained through wavelet multi-scaling- a technique that decomposes a given return series into different timescales enabling investigation at different return intervals. For some portfolios, the relative risk positions indicated by systematic co-moments at higher timescales is different from those revealed in raw returns. A strong positive (negative) linear association between beta and co-kurtosis and portfolio return in the up (down) market is observed in raw returns and at different timescales. The beta risk is priced in the up and down markets and the co-kurtosis is not. Co-skewness does not appear to be linearly associated with portfolio returns even after the up and down market split and is not priced.

Keywords: time series analysis, prediction, exponential smoothing, ARIMA models, state space models.
Abstract: In the exponential smoothing approach to forecasting, restrictions are often imposed on the smoothing parameters which ensure that certain components are exponentially weighted averages. In this paper, a new general restriction is derived on the basis that the one-step ahead prediction error can be decomposed into permanent and transient components. It is found that this general restriction reduces to the common restrictions used for simple, trend and seasonal exponential smoothing. As such, the prediction error argument provides the rationale for these restrictions.

Abstract: Data for discrete ordered random variables are often characterised by "excessive" zero observations.  Traditional ordered probit models have limited capacity in explaining the preponderance of zero observations, especially when the zeros may relate to two distinct situations of non-participation and infrequent participation (or consumption), for example.  We propose a zero-inflated ordered probit (ZIOP) model using a double-hurdle combination of a split (probit) model and an ordered probit model which, potentially, relate to different sets of covariates. Monte Carlo results suggest that the new model performs well. Finally, the model is applied to a consumer choice problem of tobacco consumption.

Keywords: Latent variable model; locally most powerful tests; approximate likelihood; correlation tests; stochastic volatility tests.
Abstract: This paper provides a general methodology for testing for dependence in time series data, with particular emphasis given to non-Gaussian data. A dynamic model is postulated for a continuous latent variable and the dynamic structure transferred to the non-Gaussian, possibly discrete, observations. Locally most powerful tests for various forms of dependence are derived, based on an approximate likelihood function. Invariance to the distribution adopted for the data, conditional on the latent process, is shown to hold in certain cases. The tests are applied to various financial data sets, and Monte Carlo experiments used to gauge their finite sample properties.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of identifying echelon canonical forms for a vector autoregressive moving average model with exogenous variables using finite algorithms.  For given values of the Kronecker indices a method for estimating the structural parameters of a model using ordinary least squares calculations is presented.  These procedures give rise, rather naturally, to a technique for the determination of the structural indices based on the use of conventional model selection criteria.  A detailed analysis of the statistical properties of the estimation and identification procedures is given and some evidence on the practical significance of the results obtained is also provided.  Modifications designed to improve the performance of the methods are presented.  Some discussion of the practical significance of the results obtained is also provided.

Abstract: This paper provides an empirical analysis of a range of alternative single-factor continuous time models for the Australian short-term interest rate. The models are indexed by the level effect parameter for the volatility in the short rate process. The inferential approach adopted is Bayesian, with estimation of the models proceeding via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation scheme. Discrimination between the alternative models is based on Bayes factors, estimated from the simulation output using the Savage-Dickey density ratio. A data augmentation approach is used to improve the accuracy of the discrete time approximation of the continuous time models. An empirical investigation is conducted using weekly observations on the Australian 90 day interest rate from January 1990 to July 2000. The Bayes factors indicate that the square root diffusion model has the highest posterior probability of all the nested models.

Keywords: Finite mixture, hidden Markov process, model selection, number of states, penalized quasi-likelihood, generalized quasi-likelihood ratio, strong consistency.
Abstract: When the unobservable Markov chain in a hidden Markov model is stationary the marginal distribution of the observations is a finite mixture with the number of terms equal to the number of the states of the Markov chain.  This suggests estimating the number of states of the unobservable Markov chain by determining the number of mixture components in the marginal distribution.  We therefore present new methods for estimating the number of states in a hidden Markov model, and coincidentally the unknown number of components in a finite mixture, based on penalized quasi-likelihood and generalized quasi-likelihood ratio methods constructed from the marginal distribution.  The procedures advocated are simple to calculate and results obtained in empirical applications indicate that they are as effective as current available methods based on the full likelihood.  We show that, under fairly general regularity conditions, the methods proposed will generate strongly consistent estimates of the unknown number of states or components.

Keywords:  Bandwidth selection, cross-validation, multivariate kernel density estimation, sampling algorithms.
Abstract: We provide Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for computing the bandwidth matrix for multivariate kernel density estimation.  Our approach is based on treating the elements of the bandwidth matrix as parameters to be estimated, which we do by optimizing the likelihood cross-validation criterion.  Numerical results show that the resulting bandwidths are superior to all existing methods; for dimensions greater than two, our algorithm is the first practical method for estimating the optimal bandwidth matrix.  Moreover, the MCMC algorithm for bandwidth selection for multivariate data has no increased difficulty as the dimension of data increases.

Keywords: CAPM, conditional market volatility, modelling conditional betas
Abstract: This paper investigates whether the risk-return relation varies, depending on changing market volatility and up/down market conditions.  Three market regimes based on the level of conditional volatility of market returns are specified - 'low', 'neutral' and 'high'.  The market model is extended to allow for these three market regimes and a three-beta asset-pricing model is developed.  For a set of US industry sector indices using a cross-sectional regression, we find that the beta risk premium in the three market volatility regimes is priced.  These significant results are uncovered only in the pricing model that accommodates up/down market conditions.

Title: Long term hedging of the Australian All Ordinaries Index using a bivariate error correction FIGARCH model

Keywords: Long memory, bivariate FIGARCH, time varying correlations, multi period minimum variance hedge ratios.
Abstract: This article compares the performance of bivariate error correction GARCH and FIGARCH models when estimating long term dynamic minimum variance hedge ratios (MVHRs) on the Australian All Ordinaries Index. The paper therefore introduces the bivariate error correction FIGARCH model into the hedging literature, which to date has only employed the GARCH class of processes. This is important for those interested in managing long term equity exposures, given that FIGARCH processes exhibit long memory, whilst the GARCH class of processes exhibit short memory. The naïve hedge ratio, the constant MVHR estimated via ordinary least squares (the OLS MVHR), the single period dynamic MVHR and the multi-period dynamic MVHR of Lee (1999) are considered. The results strongly support the estimation of dynamic MVHRs that allow for time varying correlations. Whilst long memory dependencies appear important, a multi-period dynamic MVHR that responds more rapidly to persistent changes in volatility dynamics requires development.

Keywords: basis convergence, long memory, bivariates FIGARCH, dynamic minimum variance hedge ratios.
Abstract: This paper examines the importance of basis convergence and long memory in volatility when estimating minimum variance hedge ratios (MVHRs) using SPI futures. The paper employs a bivariate FIGARCH model with a maturity effect to model the joint dynamics of the Australian All Ordinaries Index and the basis. This new approach allows for long memory in volatility, time varying correlations and the convergence between the All Ordinaries Index and its SPI futures over the life of the futures contract. The results illustrate the importance of these effects when modelling the joint dynamics and when estimating dynamic MVHRs.

Keywords: long memory, modified R/S statistic, KPSS statistic, intraday periodicity in volatility. 
Abstract: This paper tests for long memory in the volatility of the All Ordinaries Index and its Share Price Index (SPI) futures. This has important implications for those agents concerned with the long term volatility in these markets. We use daily data and a short span of high frequency data to estimate the fractional differencing parameter, examine the fit of the implied autocorrelation function, and calculate the modified R/S and KPSS test statistics. All procedures support the existence of long memory in volatility in both markets except the KPSS test on the index using daily data. We argue that this is due to the low power of the KPSS test.

Keywords: long memory, univariate and bivariate FIGARCH and FIAPARCH, asymmetries in volatility. 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the univariate FIGARCH and FIAPARCH models to a bivariate framework. We estimate bivariate error correction FIGARCH and FIAPARCH models between the All Ordinaries Index and its SPI futures using constant correlation and diagonal parameterisations. We therefore employ a flexible estimation approach that captures the long run equilibrium relationship between the two markets, bi-directional return causality, long memory and asymmetries in volatility, and time varying correlations. The results strongly support the use of this approach. Strong bi-directional return causality exists with the index bearing the burden of adjustment to deviations from long run equilibrium. The results also illustrate the importance of allowing for long memory, asymmetries in volatility, and time varying correlations.

Keywords:  Economic Growth, Growth and Inequality, Economic Contraction, Inflation and Growth.
Abstract: This paper considers the relationship between growth in real per capita GDP and the growth in real per capita GDP of the poorest 20% of a country.  It uses the data set compiled by Dollar and Kraay (2002), but come to very different conclusions.  We argue that if the purpose is to answer questions about the impact of growth on the poor, models are best estimated in growth rates.  The empirical results show that growth's impact on the poor occurs in two episodes.  First, in periods of sustained economic slowdown (negative growth over a period of at least 5 years), the poor clearly suffer more than the average.  In contrast, where economies are growing, the poor do not benefit as much as the average.  We also find that the poor benefit from growth less in periods of high inflation, and in countries with low average income.

Keywords:  Africa, South Africa, Unemployment, Informal Sector, Rural-Urban Migration, Labour Turnover 
Abstract: This paper looks at the connection between internal migration and unemployment in South Africa.  We examine whether rural-urban migrants are more likely to be unemployed, in informal sector employment or underemployed than non-migrants.  We build on standard economic theory to predict that rates of unemployment and of participation in the informal sector ought to be much higher for migrants than for non-migrants.  The empirical evidence we present, based on the 1993 and 1994 October Household Surveys, provides only some support for this theory.  Results suggest that compared to job seeking non-migrants, recent migrants do well at finding formal employment, and are much less likely to be unemployed.

Keywords: Exponential principle, power principle, constant risk aversion, ratio premium, stop-loss insurance
Abstract: When insurance claims are governed by fat-tailed distributions, gross uncertainty about the value of the tail-fatness index is virtually inescapable.  In this paper a new premium principle (the power principle) analogous to the exponential principle for thin-tailed claims, is discussed.  Pareto premiums determined under the principle have a transparent ratio structure, cater convincingly for uncertainty in the tail-fatness index, and are applicable in passage to the extremal limit, to all fat-tailed distributions in the domain of attraction of the (Frechet) extreme-value distribution. Cover can be provided for part claims if existence of the claims mean is in doubt. Stop-loss premiums are also discussed.  Mathematical requirements are very modest.
