Abstract: This paper lays the groundwork for a unifying approach to stochastic dominance testing under survey nonresponse that integrates the partial identification approach to incomplete data and design-based inference for complex survey data. We propose a novel inference procedure for restricted sth-order stochastic dominance, tailored to accommodate a broad spectrum of nonresponse assumptions. The method uses pseudo-empirical likelihood to formulate the test statistic and compares it to a critical value from the chi​ squared distribution with one degree of freedom. We detail the procedure’s asymptotic properties under both null and alternative hypotheses, establishing its uniform validity under the null and consistency against various alternatives. Using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, we demonstrate the procedure’s utility in a sensitivity analysis of temporal poverty comparisons among Australian households.

Abstract: Various risk-limiting audit (RLA) methods have been developed for instant-runoff voting (IRV) elections. A recent method, AWAIRE, is the first 
efficient approach that can take advantage of but does not require cast vote records (CVRs). AWAIRE involves adaptively weighted averages of test 
statistics, essentially “learning” an effective set of hypotheses to test. However, the initial paper on AWAIRE only examined a few weighting schemes 
and parameter settings. 

We explore schemes and settings more extensively, to identify and recommend efficient choices for practice. We focus on the case where CVRs are not 
available, assessing performance using simulations based on real election data. 

The most effective schemes are often those that place most or all of the weight on the apparent “best” hypotheses based on already seen data. 
Conversely, the optimal tuning parameters tended to vary based on the election margin. Nonetheless, we quantify the performance trade-offs 
for different choices across varying election margins, aiding in selecting the most desirable trade-off if a default option is needed. 

A limitation of the current AWAIRE implementation is its restriction to a small number of candidates -- up to six in previous implementations. 
One path to a more computationally efficient implementation would be to use lazy evaluation and avoid considering all possible hypotheses. 
Our findings suggest that such an approach could be done without substantially compromising statistical performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an easy-to-implement residual-based specification testing procedure for detecting structural changes 
in factor models, which is powerful against both smooth and abrupt structural changes with unknown break dates. The proposed test is 
robust against the over-specified number of factors, and serially and cross sectionally correlated error processes. A new central limit 
theorem is given for the quadratic forms of panel data with dependence over both dimensions, thereby filling a gap in the literature. 
We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed test statistic, and accordingly develop a simulation-based scheme to select 
critical value in order to improve finite sample performance. Through extensive simulations and a real-world application, we confirm 
our theoretical results and demonstrate that the proposed test exhibits desirable size and power in practice.

Keywords: Asset Pricing; Concentration Inequality; Heavy-Tailed Distribution; High Dimensional Long-Run Covariance Matrix; Thresholding
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a robust estimation and inferential method for high dimensional panel data models. Specifically, 
(1) we investigate the case where the number of regressors can grow faster than the sample size, (2) we pay particular attention to 
non-Gaussian, serially and cross-sectionally correlated and heteroskedastic error processes, and (3) we develop an estimation method 
for high-dimensional long-run covariance matrix using a thresholded estimator. Methodologically and technically, we develop two 
Nagaev-types of concentration inequalities: one for a partial sum and the other for a quadratic form, subject to a set of easily 
verifiable conditions. Leveraging these two inequalities, we also derive a non-asymptotic bound for the LASSO estimator, achieve 
asymptotic normality via the node-wise LASSO regression, and establish a sharp convergence rate for the thresholded heteroskedasticity 
and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimator. Our study thus provides the relevant literature with a complete toolkit for conducting 
inference about the parameters of interest involved in a high-dimensional panel data framework. We also demonstrate the practical 
relevance of these theoretical results by investigating a high-dimensional panel data model with interactive fixed effects. Moreover, 
we conduct extensive numerical studies using simulated and real data examples.

Keywords: Asymptotic Theory; Bias Correction; Dependent Wild Bootstrap; Hierarchical Model
Abstract: IHierarchical panel data models have recently garnered significant attention. This study contributes to the relevant literature 
by introducing a novel three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical panel data model, which integrates panel regression with three sets of latent 
factor structures: one set of global factors and two sets of local factors. Instead of aggregating latent factors from various nodes, as 
seen in the literature of distributed principal component analysis (PCA), we propose an estimation approach capable of recovering the 
parameters of interest and disentangling latent factors at different levels and across different dimensions. We establish an asymptotic 
theory and provide a bootstrap procedure to obtain inference for the parameters of interest while accommodating various types of 
cross-sectional dependence and time series autocorrelation. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework by examining 
productivity convergence in manufacturing industries worldwide.

Keywords: Estimation Theory; Deep Neural Network; Hierarchical Model; ReLU
Abstract: In this paper, we consider estimation and inference for the unknown parameters and function involved in a class of generalized 
hierarchical models. Such models are of great interest in the literature of neural networks (such as Bauer and Kohler, 2019). We propose 
a rectified linear unit (ReLU) based deep neural network (DNN) approach, and contribute to the design of DNN by i) providing more transparency 
for practical implementation, ii) defining different types of sparsity, iii) showing the differentiability, iv) pointing out the set of 
effective parameters, and v) offering a new variant of rectified linear activation function (ReLU), etc. Asymptotic properties are 
established accordingly, and a feasible procedure for the purpose of inference is also proposed. We conduct extensive numerical studies 
to examine the finite-sample performance of the estimation methods, and we also evaluate the empirical relevance and applicability of 
the proposed models and estimation methods to real data.

Abstract: Single Transferable Vote (STV) elections are a principled
approach to electing multiple candidates in a single election. Each ballot
has a starting value of 1, and a candidate is elected if they gather a total
vote value more than a defined quota. Votes over the quota have their
value reduced by a transfer value so as to remove the quota, and are
passed to the next candidate on the ballot. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs)
are a statistically sound approach to election auditing which guarantees
that failure to detect an error in the result is bounded by a limit. A
first approach to RLAs for 2-seat STV elections has been defined. In this
paper we show how we can improve this approach by reasoning about
lower bounds on transfer values, and how we can extend the approach to
partially audit an election, if the method does not support a full audit.

Title: The Information Projection in Moment Inequality Models: Existence, Dual Representation, and Approximation

Keywords: I-Projection; Moment Inequality Constraints; Approximation; Convergence
Abstract: This paper presents new existence, dual representation, and approximation results
for the information projection (I-projection) in the infinite-dimensional setting for moment inequality
constraint sets. These results are established under a general specification of the moment inequalities,
nesting both conditional and unconditional moments and allowing for an infinite number of such
inequalities. An essential innovation of the paper is the exhibition of the dual variable as a weak
vector-valued integral, enabling the formulation of an approximation scheme of the I-projection's
equivalent Fenchel dual problem. In particular, we show under suitable assumptions that the values
of finite-dimensional programs can approximate the dual problem's optimum value and that, in
addition, every accumulation point of a sequence of optimal solutions for the approximating programs
is an optimal solution of the dual problem.

Abstract: A common problem in many disciplines is the need to assign a set of items into categories
or classes with known labels. This is often done by one or more expert raters, or sometimes by an
automated process. If these assignments or `ratings' are difficult to make accurately, a common tactic
is to repeat them by different raters, or even by the same rater multiple times on different occasions.
We present an R package rater, available on CRAN, that implements Bayesian versions of several
statistical models for analysis of repeated categorical rating data. Inference is possible for the true
underlying (latent) class of each item, as well as the accuracy of each rater. The models are extensions
of, and include, the Dawid-Skene model, and we implemented them using the Stan probabilistic
programming language. We illustrate the use of rater through a few examples. We also discuss in
detail the techniques of marginalisation and conditioning, which are necessary for these models but
also apply more generally to other models implemented in Stan. This article was originally published in 
The R Journal (https://doi.org/10.32614/RJ-2023-064).
