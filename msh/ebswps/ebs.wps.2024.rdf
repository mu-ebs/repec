Abstract: This paper presents new existence, dual representation, and approximation results
for the information projection (I-projection) in the infinite-dimensional setting for moment inequality
constraint sets. These results are established under a general specification of the moment inequalities,
nesting both conditional and unconditional moments and allowing for an infinite number of such
inequalities. An essential innovation of the paper is the exhibition of the dual variable as a weak
vector-valued integral, enabling the formulation of an approximation scheme of the I-projection's
equivalent Fenchel dual problem. In particular, we show under suitable assumptions that the values
of finite-dimensional programs can approximate the dual problem's optimum value and that, in
addition, every accumulation point of a sequence of optimal solutions for the approximating programs
is an optimal solution of the dual problem.

Abstract: A common problem in many disciplines is the need to assign a set of items into categories
or classes with known labels. This is often done by one or more expert raters, or sometimes by an
automated process. If these assignments or ‘ratings’ are difficult to make accurately, a common tactic
is to repeat them by different raters, or even by the same rater multiple times on different occasions.
We present an R package rater, available on CRAN, that implements Bayesian versions of several
statistical models for analysis of repeated categorical rating data. Inference is possible for the true
underlying (latent) class of each item, as well as the accuracy of each rater. The models are extensions
of, and include, the Dawid–Skene model, and we implemented them using the Stan probabilistic
programming language. We illustrate the use of rater through a few examples. We also discuss in
detail the techniques of marginalisation and conditioning, which are necessary for these models but
also apply more generally to other models implemented in Stan. This article was originally published in 
The R Journal (https://doi.org/10.32614/RJ-2023-064).
