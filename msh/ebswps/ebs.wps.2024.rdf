Keywords: Information Leakage; Tardy News; Public News; Realized Volatility
Abstract: We introduce the tardy news hypothesis as a new channel that complements information leakage to explain why
volatility rises before public news. Through a novel information processing framework, we show that both channels can
lead to bias and inconsistency in the estimated relationship between news and volatility, and we establish bounds for
the true relationship. Using a dataset that combines realized volatility withRavenPack news analytics for S&amp;P 500
constituents, we find that the type of events anews item covers is related to the likelihood of a rise in pre-news
volatility, and the sizeof the firm is related to the magnitude of the rise. This heterogeneity from event andfirm
types is consistent with the tardy news hypothesis.

Keywords: Conformal Prediction; Coverage Guarantee; Distribution-Free Inference; Exchangeability; Weighted Quantile Estimate
Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing distribution-free prediction intervals for multi-step​ time series
forecasting, with a focus on the temporal dependencies inherent in multi-step forecast​ errors. We establish that the
optimal h-step-ahead forecast errors exhibit serial correlation​ up to lag (h-1) under a general non-stationary
autoregressive data generating process. To​ leverage these properties, we propose the Autocorrelated Multi-step
Conformal Prediction (AcMCP) method, which effectively incorporates autocorrelations in multi-step forecast errors,
resulting in more statistically efficient prediction intervals. This method ensures theoretical​ long-run coverage
guarantees for multi-step prediction intervals, though we note that increasedf​ orecasting horizons may exacerbate
deviations from the target coverage, particularly in the​ context of limited sample sizes. Additionally, we extend
several easy-to-implement conformal prediction methods, originally designed for single-step forecasting,
to accommodate multi-step scenarios. Through empirical evaluations, including simulations and applications to data,
we demonstrate that AcMCP achieves coverage that closely aligns with the target within local windows, while providing
adaptive prediction intervals that effectively respond to varying conditions.

Abstract: We study the problem of choosing the copula when the marginal distributions of a random
vector are not all continuous. Inspired by four motivating examples including simulation from
copulas, stress scenarios, co-risk measures, and dependence measures, we propose to use the
checkerboard copula, that is, intuitively, the unique copula with a distribution that is as uniform
as possible within regions of flexibility. We show that the checkerboard copula has the
largest Shannon entropy, which means that it carries the least information among all possible
copulas for a given random vector. Furthermore, the checkerboard copula preserves the dependence
information of the original random vector, leading to two applications in the context of
diversification penalty and impact portfolios. The numerical and empirical results illustrate the
benefits of using the checkerboard copula in the calculation of co-risk measures.

Keywords: Signed Choquet Integrals; Risk Sharing; Inter-Quantile Difference; Variability Measures; Pairwise Counter-Monotonicity
Abstract: We address the problem of sharing risk among agents with preferences modelled by a generalclass 
of comonotonic additive and law-invariant functionals that need not be either monotoneor convex. Such 
functionals are called distortion riskmetrics, which include many statisticalmeasures of risk and variability 
used in portfolio optimization and insurance. The set of Pareto Optimal allocations is characterized under
various settings of general or comonotonic risk sharing problems. We solve explicitly Pareto-optimal allocations 
among agents using the Gini deviation, the mean-median deviation, or the inter-quantile difference as the relevant 
variability measures. The latter is of particular interest, as optimal allocations are not comonotonic in the 
presenceof inter-quantile difference agents; instead, the optimal allocation features a mixture of pairwise 
counter-monotonic structures, showing some patterns of extremal negative dependence.

Keywords: Correlation Coefficient; Dependence Matrices; Frechet Copula; Positive RegressionDependence
Abstract: A useful property of independent samples is that their correlation remains the sameafter 
applying marginal transforms. This invariance property plays a fundamental role instatistical inference, 
but does not hold in general for dependent samples. In this paper, we study this invariance property on the 
Pearson correlation coefficient and its applications. A multivariate random vector is said to have an 
invariant correlation if its pairwise correlation coefficients remain unchanged under any common marginal 
transforms. For abivariate case, we characterize all models of such a random vector via a certain combination
of comonotonicity -- the strongest form of positive dependence -- and independence. In particular, we show that 
the class of exchangeable copulas with invariant correlation is preciselydescribed by what we call 
positive Frechet copulas. In the general multivariate case, we characterize the set of all invariant 
correlation matrices via the clique partition polytope. We also propose a positive regression dependent 
model that admits any prescribed invariantcorrelation matrix. Finally, we show that all our characterization 
results of invariant correlation, except one special case, remain the same if the common marginal transforms 
are confined to the set of increasing ones.

Abstract: Forecasting often involves high-dimensional predictors which have nonlinear relationships 
with theoutcome of interest. Nonparametric additive index models can capture these relationships, 
while addressing the curse of dimensionality. This paper introduces a new algorithm, Sparse Multiple 
Index(SMI) Modelling, tailored for estimating high-dimensional nonparametric/semi-parametric additive
index models, while limiting the number of parameters to estimate, by optimising predictor selectionand 
predictor grouping. The SMI Modelling algorithm uses an iterative approach based on mixed integer 
programming to solve an L0-regularised nonlinear least squares optimisation problem withlinear constraints. 
We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm through a simulation study, along with two empirical 
applications to forecast heat-related daily mortality and daily solarintensity.

Abstract: AWAIRE is one of two extant methods for conducting risk limiting audits of instant-runoff voting (IRV) elections. 
In principle AWAIRE can audit IRV contests with any number of candidates, but the original implementation incurred memory 
and computation costs that grew super exponentially with the number of candidates. This paper improves the algorithmic 
implementation of AWAIRE in three ways that make it practical to audit IRV contests with 55 candidates, compared to 
the previous 6 candidates. First, rather than trying from the start to rule out all candidate elimination orders that 
produce a different winner, the algorithm starts by considering only the final round, testing statistically whether 
each candidate could have won that round. For those candidates who cannot be ruled out at that stage, it expands to 
consider earlier and earlier rounds until either it provides strong evidence that the reported winner really won or 
a full hand count is conducted, revealing who really won. Second, it tests a richer collection of conditions, some 
of which can rule out many elimination orders at once. Third, it exploits relationships among those conditions, 
allowing it to abandon testing those that are unlikely to help. We provide real-world examples with up to 36 
candidates and synthetic examples with up to 55 candidates, showing how audit sample size depends on the margins 
and on the tuning parameters. An open-source Python implementation is publicly available.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a semiparametric regression model under the context 
of treatment effects via a localized neural network (LNN) approach. Due to a vast number of parameters 
involved, wereduce the number of effective parameters by (i) exploring the use of identification 
restrictions; and (ii)adopting a variable selection method based on the group-LASSO technique. 
Subsequently, we derive thecorresponding estimation theory and propose a dependent wild bootstrap 
procedure to construct validinferences accounting for the dependence of data. Finally, we validate 
our theoretical findings through extensive numerical studies. In an empirical study, we revisit the 
impacts of a tightening monetary policyaction on a variety of economic variables, including 
short-/long-term interest rate, inflation, unemployment rate, industrial price and equity return 
via the newly proposed framework using a monthly datasetof the US.

Abstract: We propose a novel forecast linear augmented projection (FLAP) method that can reduce the 
forecasterror variance of any multivariate forecast. The method first constructs new component series 
which are linear combinations of the original series. Forecasts are then generated for both the original 
and component series. Finally, the full vector of forecasts is projected onto a linear subspace where 
the constraints implied by the combination weights hold. We show that the projection using the 
original forecast error covariance matrix will result in improved forecasts. Notably, the new forecast 
error variance of each series is non-increasing with the number of components, and mild conditions are 
established for which it is strictly decreasing. It is also shown that the proposed method achieves 
maximum forecast error variance reduction among linear projection methods. We demonstrateour proposed 
method with an estimated covariance matrix using simulations and two empirical applications based on 
Australian tourism and FRED-MD data. In all cases, forecasts are improved. Notably, using FLAP with 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to construct the new series leads tosubstantial forecast error 
variance reduction.

Abstract: This paper lays the groundwork for a unifying approach to stochastic dominance testing 
under survey nonresponse that integrates the partial identification approach to incomplete data 
and design-based inference for complex survey data. We propose a novel inference procedure for 
restricted sth-order stochastic dominance, tailored to accommodate a broad spectrum of 
nonresponse assumptions. The method uses pseudo-empirical likelihood to formulate the test 
statistic and compares it to a critical value from the chi​ squared distribution with one 
degree of freedom. We detail the procedure’s asymptotic properties under both null and 
alternative hypotheses, establishing its uniform validity under the null and consistency 
against various alternatives. Using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia 
survey, we demonstrate the procedure’s utility in a sensitivity analysis of temporal poverty 
comparisons among Australian households.

Abstract: Various risk-limiting audit (RLA) methods have been developed for instant-runoff voting (IRV) elections. A recent method, AWAIRE, is the first 
efficient approach that can take advantage of but does not require cast vote records (CVRs). AWAIRE involves adaptively weighted averages of test 
statistics, essentially "learning" an effective set of hypotheses to test. However, the initial paper on AWAIRE only examined a few weighting schemes 
and parameter settings. 

We explore schemes and settings more extensively, to identify and recommend efficient choices for practice. We focus on the case where CVRs are not 
available, assessing performance using simulations based on real election data. 

The most effective schemes are often those that place most or all of the weight on the apparent "best" hypotheses based on already seen data. 
Conversely, the optimal tuning parameters tended to vary based on the election margin. Nonetheless, we quantify the performance trade-offs 
for different choices across varying election margins, aiding in selecting the most desirable trade-off if a default option is needed. 

A limitation of the current AWAIRE implementation is its restriction to a small number of candidates -- up to six in previous implementations. 
One path to a more computationally efficient implementation would be to use lazy evaluation and avoid considering all possible hypotheses. 
Our findings suggest that such an approach could be done without substantially compromising statistical performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an easy-to-implement residual-based specification testing procedure for detecting structural changes 
in factor models, which is powerful against both smooth and abrupt structural changes with unknown break dates. The proposed test is 
robust against the over-specified number of factors, and serially and cross sectionally correlated error processes. A new central limit 
theorem is given for the quadratic forms of panel data with dependence over both dimensions, thereby filling a gap in the literature. 
We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed test statistic, and accordingly develop a simulation-based scheme to select 
critical value in order to improve finite sample performance. Through extensive simulations and a real-world application, we confirm 
our theoretical results and demonstrate that the proposed test exhibits desirable size and power in practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a robust estimation and inferential method for high dimensional panel data models. Specifically, 
(1) we investigate the case where the number of regressors can grow faster than the sample size, (2) we pay particular attention to 
non-Gaussian, serially and cross-sectionally correlated and heteroskedastic error processes, and (3) we develop an estimation method 
for high-dimensional long-run covariance matrix using a thresholded estimator. Methodologically and technically, we develop two 
Nagaev-types of concentration inequalities: one for a partial sum and the other for a quadratic form, subject to a set of easily 
verifiable conditions. Leveraging these two inequalities, we also derive a non-asymptotic bound for the LASSO estimator, achieve 
asymptotic normality via the node-wise LASSO regression, and establish a sharp convergence rate for the thresholded heteroskedasticity 
and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimator. Our study thus provides the relevant literature with a complete toolkit for conducting 
inference about the parameters of interest involved in a high-dimensional panel data framework. We also demonstrate the practical 
relevance of these theoretical results by investigating a high-dimensional panel data model with interactive fixed effects. Moreover, 
we conduct extensive numerical studies using simulated and real data examples.

Keywords: Asymptotic Theory; Bias Correction; Dependent Wild Bootstrap; Hierarchical Model
Abstract: Hierarchical panel data models have recently garnered significant attention. This study contributes to the relevant literature 
by introducing a novel three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical panel data model, which integrates panel regression with three sets of latent 
factor structures: one set of global factors and two sets of local factors. Instead of aggregating latent factors from various nodes, as 
seen in the literature of distributed principal component analysis (PCA), we propose an estimation approach capable of recovering the 
parameters of interest and disentangling latent factors at different levels and across different dimensions. We establish an asymptotic 
theory and provide a bootstrap procedure to obtain inference for the parameters of interest while accommodating various types of 
cross-sectional dependence and time series autocorrelation. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework by examining 
productivity convergence in manufacturing industries worldwide.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider estimation and inference for the unknown parameters and function involved in a class of generalized 
hierarchical models. Such models are of great interest in the literature of neural networks (such as Bauer and Kohler, 2019). We propose 
a rectified linear unit (ReLU) based deep neural network (DNN) approach, and contribute to the design of DNN by i) providing more transparency 
for practical implementation, ii) defining different types of sparsity, iii) showing the differentiability, iv) pointing out the set of 
effective parameters, and v) offering a new variant of rectified linear activation function (ReLU), etc. Asymptotic properties are 
established accordingly, and a feasible procedure for the purpose of inference is also proposed. We conduct extensive numerical studies 
to examine the finite-sample performance of the estimation methods, and we also evaluate the empirical relevance and applicability of 
the proposed models and estimation methods to real data.

Abstract: This paper introduces a flexible time-varying network vector autoregressive model framework for 
large-scale time series. A latent group structure is imposed on the heterogeneous and node-specific time-varying 
momentum and network spillover effects so that the number of unknown time-varying coefficients to be estimated 
can be reduced considerably. A classic agglomerative clustering algorithm with nonparametrically estimated 
distance matrix is combined with a ratio criterion to consistently estimate the latent group number and 
membership. A post-grouping local linear smoothing method is proposed to estimate the group-specific 
time-varying momentum and network effects, substantially improving the convergence rates of the 
preliminary estimates which ignore the latent structure. We further modify the methodology and theory 
to allow for structural breaks in either the group membership, group number or group-specific coefficient 
functions. Numerical studies including Monte-Carlo simulation and an empirical application are presented 
to examine the finite-sample performance of the developed model and methodology.

Abstract: Forecast reconciliation ensures forecasts of time series in a hierarchy adhere 
to aggregation constraints, enabling aligned decision making. While forecast 
reconciliation can enhance overall accuracy in hierarchical or grouped structures, 
the most substantial improvements occur in series with initially poor-performing
base forecasts. Nevertheless, certain series may experience deteriorations in reconciled 
forecasts. In practical settings, series in a structure often exhibit poor base 
forecasts due to model misspecification or low forecastability. To prevent their 
negative impact, we propose two categories of forecast reconciliation methods that 
incorporate time series selection based on out-of-sample and in-sample information,
respectively. These methods keep "poor" base forecasts unused in forming reconciled 
forecasts, while adjusting weights allocated to the remaining series accordingly when 
generating bottom-level reconciled forecasts. Additionally, our methods ameliorate 
disparities stemming from varied estimates of the base forecast error covariance matrix, 
alleviating challenges associated with estimator selection. Empirical evaluations through 
two simulation studies and applications using Australian labour force and domestic 
tourism data demonstrate improved forecast accuracy, particularly evident in higher 
aggregation levels, longer forecast horizons, and cases involving model misspecification.

Abstract: Various risk-limiting audit (RLA) methods have been developed
for instant-runoff voting (IRV) elections. A recent method, AWAIRE,
is the first efficient approach that does not require cast vote records
(CVRs). AWAIRE involves adaptively weighted averages of test statistics,
essentially "learning" an effective set of hypotheses to test. However,
the initial paper on AWAIRE only examined a few weighting schemes and
parameter settings.

We provide an extensive exploration of schemes and settings, to identify
and recommend efficient choices for practical use. We focus only on the
(hardest) case where CVRs are not available, using simulations based on
real election data to assess performance.

Across our comparisons, the most effective schemes are often those that
place most or all of the weight on the apparent "best" hypotheses based
on already seen data. Conversely, the optimal tuning parameters tended
to vary based on the election margin. Nonetheless, we quantify the performance
trade-offs for different choices across varying election margins,
aiding in selecting the most desirable trade-off if a default option is
needed.

A limitation of the current AWAIRE implementation is its restriction to
handling a small number of candidates (previously demonstrated up to
six candidates). One path to a more computationally efficient implementation
would be to use lazy evaluation and avoid considering all possible
hypotheses. Our findings suggest that such an approach could be done
without substantially compromising statistical performance.

Abstract: Single Transferable Vote (STV) elections are a principled
approach to electing multiple candidates in a single election. Each ballot
has a starting value of 1, and a candidate is elected if they gather a total
vote value more than a defined quota. Votes over the quota have their
value reduced by a transfer value so as to remove the quota, and are
passed to the next candidate on the ballot. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs)
are a statistically sound approach to election auditing which guarantees
that failure to detect an error in the result is bounded by a limit. A
first approach to RLAs for 2-seat STV elections has been defined. In this
paper we show how we can improve this approach by reasoning about
lower bounds on transfer values, and how we can extend the approach to
partially audit an election, if the method does not support a full audit.

Title: The Information Projection in Moment Inequality Models: Existence, Dual Representation, and Approximation

Keywords: I-Projection; Moment Inequality Constraints; Approximation; Convergence
Abstract: This paper presents new existence, dual representation, and approximation results
for the information projection (I-projection) in the infinite-dimensional setting for moment inequality
constraint sets. These results are established under a general specification of the moment inequalities,
nesting both conditional and unconditional moments and allowing for an infinite number of such
inequalities. An essential innovation of the paper is the exhibition of the dual variable as a weak
vector-valued integral, enabling the formulation of an approximation scheme of the I-projection's
equivalent Fenchel dual problem. In particular, we show under suitable assumptions that the values
of finite-dimensional programs can approximate the dual problem's optimum value and that, in
addition, every accumulation point of a sequence of optimal solutions for the approximating programs
is an optimal solution of the dual problem.

Abstract: A common problem in many disciplines is the need to assign a set of items into categories
or classes with known labels. This is often done by one or more expert raters, or sometimes by an
automated process. If these assignments or `ratings' are difficult to make accurately, a common tactic
is to repeat them by different raters, or even by the same rater multiple times on different occasions.
We present an R package rater, available on CRAN, that implements Bayesian versions of several
statistical models for analysis of repeated categorical rating data. Inference is possible for the true
underlying (latent) class of each item, as well as the accuracy of each rater. The models are extensions
of, and include, the Dawid-Skene model, and we implemented them using the Stan probabilistic
programming language. We illustrate the use of rater through a few examples. We also discuss in
detail the techniques of marginalisation and conditioning, which are necessary for these models but
also apply more generally to other models implemented in Stan. This article was originally published in 
The R Journal (https://doi.org/10.32614/RJ-2023-064).
