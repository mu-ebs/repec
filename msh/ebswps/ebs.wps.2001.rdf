Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to provide analytical expression for forecast 
    variances that can be used in prediction intervals for the exponential smoothing 
    methods. These expressions are based on state space models with a single source of 
    error that underlie the exponential smoothing methods. In cases where an ARIMA model 
    also underlies an exponential smoothing method, there is an equivalent state space 
    model with the same variance expression. We also discuss relationships between these 
    new ideas and previous suggestions for finding forecast variances and prediction 
    intervals for the exponential smoothing methods.

Length: 15 pages
Abstract: R, an open-source programming environment for data analysis and graphics, has 
    in only a decade grown to become a de-facto standard for statistical analysis 
    against which many popular commercial programs may be measured. The use of R for 
    the teaching of econometric methods is appealing. It provides cutting-edge
        statistical methods which are, by R's open-source nature, available immediately. 
    The software is stable,available at no cost, and exists for a number of platforms. 
    This review focuses on using R for teaching econometrics. Since R is an extremely 
    powerful environment, this review should also be of interest to researchers.

Abstract: We use the information content in the decisions of the NBER Business cycle 
    Dating Committee to construct coincident and leading indices of economic 
    activity for United States. Specifically, we use canonical correlation analysis 
    to filter out the noisy information contained in the coincident series. 
    Finally, to construct our preferred coincident index of the U.S. business cycle, 
    we take account of measurement error in the commonly used coincident series by 
    using instrumental-variable methods. The resulting index is a simple linear 
    combination of four coincident series that encompassed
    currently popular coincident indices.

Abstract: This paper introduces similarity among strategies in the payoff assessment 
    model of choice (Sarin and Vahid (1999, GEB)). The assessments of strategies that 
    are more similar to the chosen strategy are updated more similarly to the 
    chosen strategy. We use this model to explain a recent experiment.

Length: 36 pages
Abstract: This paper studies linear and linear autoregressive leading indicator 
    models of business cycles in OECD countries. The models use the spread 
    between short-term and long-term interest rates as leading indicators
    for GDP, and their success in capturing business cycles gauged by the 
    non-parametric procedures developed by Harding and Pagan (2001). Our 
    preliminary findings indicate that bivariate nonlinear models of output and
    the interest rate spread can successfully capture the shape of the business 
    cycle. In particular, they can capture the features of recession and the 
    deviation of the actual path of the cycles from a triangular approximation 
    to this path, both characteristics that other models of GDP fail to reproduce.

    diverse populations, geographical locations and varying levels of air 
    pollution and climate. The aims of this paper are: (1) to assess the 
    sensitivity of the observed pollution effects to model specification, 
    with particular emphasis on the inclusion of seasonally adjusted covariates; 
    and (2) to study the effect of air pollution on respiratory disease in 
    Melbourne, Australia.

Abstract: The Theta method of forecasting performed particularly well in the 
    M3-competition and is therefore of interest to forecast practitioners. 
    The description of the method given by Assimakopoulos and Nikolopoulos 
    (2000) involves several pages of algebraic manipulation and is difficult 
    to comprehend. We show that the method can be expressed much more simply; 
    furthermore we show that the forecasts obtained are equivalent to simple 
    exponential smoothing with drift.

Keywords: Hypothesis test; Significance; p value; Probability Model; Statistical model; 
    Prediction
Length: 22 pages
Abstract: Hypothesis testing is widely regarded as an essential part of statistics, 
    but it s use in research has led to considerable controversy in a number of 
    disciplines, especially psychology, with a number of commentators suggesting 
    it should not be used at all. A root cause of this controversy was the 
    overenthusiastic adoption of hypothesis testing, based on a greatly exaggerated 
    view of its role in research. A second cause was confusion between the two 
    forms of hypothesis testing developed by Fisher on the one hand and Neyman and 
    Pearson on the other. This paper discusses these two causes, and also proposes 
    that there is a more general misunderstanding of the role of hypothesis testing. 
    This misunderstanding is reflected in vocabulary such as 'the true value' of the 
    parameter.

Abstract: This paper studies the All Ordinaries Index in Australia, and its futures 
    contract known as the Share Price Index. We use a new form of smooth transition 
    model to account for a variety of nonlinearities caused by transaction costs 
    and other market/data imperfections, and given the recent interest in the 
    effects of market automation on price discovery, we focus on how the nonlinear 
    properties of the basis and returns have changed, now that floor trading in 
    futures contract has been replaced by electronic trading.

Abstract: In this paper we compare two non-stationary time series using non-parametric

    tests are performed on groups of spectral estimates for both related and 
    independent time series. Simul ation studies show that in certain cases the 
    tests perform reasonably well. The tests are applied to observed geological 
    and financial time series.
