Abstract: The 2011 Clean Energy Act sought to align Australiaâ€™s carbon pricing to the
2005 European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) by 2015, but this act
was repealed in 2014. We estimate the hypothetical impact of Australia adopting
an emissions trading policy in 2005, which corresponds with the establishment of
the EU-ETS. We use a synthetic treatment approach that constructs a counterfactual measure 
of Australian carbon emissions that makes use of the time series
properties of pre-2005 and post-2005 emissions in European countries. We find that
Australian per-capita carbon emissions would have been lower by about 4.5% as a
result of the policy -- a result that is robust to several variations of our methodology.

Keywords: generalized method of moments, high dimensional moment model, interactive effect,
over-identification issue, panel data, sieve method
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of high dimensional moment restriction panel data models 
with interactive effects, where factors are unobserved and factor loadings are nonparametrically 
unknown smooth functions of individual characteristics variables. We allow the dimension of the 
parameter vector and the number of moment conditions to diverge with sample size. This is a very 
general framework and includes many existing linear and nonlinear panel data models as special 
cases. In order to estimate the unknown parameters, factors and factor loadings, we propose a 
sieve-based generalized method of moments estimation method and we show that under a set of 
simple identification conditions, all those unknown quantities can be consistently estimated. 
Further we establish asymptotic distributions of the proposed estimators. In addition, we propose 
tests for over-identification, specification of factor loading functions, and establish their 
large sample properties. Moreover, a number of simulation studies are conducted to examine the 
performance of the proposed estimators and test statistics in finite samples. An empirical 
example on stock return prediction is studied to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed 
framework and corresponding estimation methods and testing procedures.

Keywords: average treatment effects, causal inference; Hermite series expansion,

Abstract: We propose a semiparametric method to estimate the average treatment effect
under the assumption of unconfoundedness given observational data. Our estimation
method alleviates misspecification issues of the propensity score function by estimating 
the single-index link function involved through Hermite polynomials. Our
approach is computationally tractable and allows for moderately large dimension
covariates. We provide the large sample properties of the estimator and show its validity. 
Also, the average treatment effect estimator achieves the parametric rate and
asymptotic normality. Our extensive Monte Carlo study shows that the proposed estimator 
is valid in finite samples. We also provide an empirical analysis on the effect
of maternal smoking on babies' birth weight and the effect of job training program
on future earnings.

Keywords: bootstrap method, interactive fixed-effect, panel rainfall data, time trend
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a panel data model which allows for heterogeneous time
trends at different locations. We propose a new estimation method for the panel data
model before we establish an asymptotic theory for the proposed estimation method.
For inferential purposes, we develop a bootstrap method for the case where weak
correlation presents in both dimensions of the error terms. We examine the finite-sample 
properties of the proposed model and estimation method through extensive
simulated studies. Finally, we use the newly proposed model and method to investigate 
rainfall, temperature and sunshine data of U.K. respectively. Overall, we find
the weather of winter has changed dramatically over the past fifty years. Changes
may vary with respect to locations for the other seasons.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a wide class of time-varying multivariate causal 
processes that nests many classical and new examples as special cases. We first prove
the existence of a weakly dependent stationary approximation for our model which
is the foundation to initiate the theoretical development. Afterwards, we consider
the QMLE estimation approach, and provide both point-wise and simultaneous inferences 
on the coefficient functions. In addition, we demonstrate the theoretical
findings through both simulated and real data examples. In particular, we show
the empirical relevance of our study using an application to evaluate the conditional
correlations between the stock markets of China and U.S. We find that the 
interdependence between the two stock markets is increasing over time.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simple dependent wild bootstrap procedure for us to
establish valid inferences for a wide class of panel data models including those with
interactive fixed effects. The proposed method allows for the error components having weak 
correlation over both dimensions, and heteroskedasticity. The asymptotic
properties are established under a set of simple and general conditions, and bridge
the literature on bootstrap methods and the literature of heteroskedasticity and autocorrlation 
consistent (HAC) approaches for panel data models. The new findings fill
some gaps left by the bulk literature of the block bootstrap based panel data studies.
Finally, we show the superiority of our approach over several natural competitors using
extensive numerical studies.

Keywords: forecast combination, forecast combination puzzle, probabilistic forecasting,
scoring rules, S&P500 forecasting, two-stage estimation
Abstract: We investigate the performance and sampling variability of estimated forecast
combinations, with particular attention given to the combination of forecast distributions. 
Unknown parameters in the forecast combination are optimized according
to criterion functions based on proper scoring rules, which are chosen to reward the
form of forecast accuracy that matters for the problem at hand, and forecast performance 
is measured using the out-of-sample expectation of said scoring rule. Our
results provide novel insights into the behavior of estimated forecast combinations.
Firstly, we show that, asymptotically, the sampling variability in the performance of
standard forecast combinations is determined solely by estimation of the constituent
models, with estimation of the combination weights contributing no sampling variability 
whatsoever, at first order. Secondly, we show that, if computationally feasible,
forecast combinations produced in a single step -- in which the constituent model and
combination function parameters are estimated jointly -- have superior predictive 
accuracy and lower sampling variability than standard forecast combinations -- where
constituent model and combination function parameters are estimated in two steps.
These theoretical insights are demonstrated numerically, both in simulation settings
and in an extensive empirical illustration using a time series of S&P500 returns

Abstract: In a world with costly transfers, some agents with high transaction costs may not find it feasible
to trade. Hence, their consumption will co-vary with their endowment, leading to imperfect risksharing. 
In this paper, we augment the canonical risk-sharing model to incorporate frictions in
the form of transaction costs. In this augmented model, given a particular network structure, risk
sharing will happen within networks and not the whole universe of agents. We show that transaction 
costs and the implied network structure of trade have important implications for the tests
of risk sharing. Using this model, we derive a structural risk-sharing test that uses consumption
and production data alongside the trade network structure. We implement our method using data
from the global trade of three major staple food commodities. Comparing our estimates with the
benchmark of frictionless trade, we find some evidence of transaction costs impeding risk-sharing
in these commodities.

Keywords: Convergence in manufacturing, cross-sectional dependence, growth regression, hierarchical model
Abstract: Despite its paramount importance in the empirical growth literature, productivity convergence 
analysis has three issues that have yet to be addressed: (1) the hierarchical structure of industry-level 
datasets has little been fully explored; (2) industry-level technology heterogeneity has largely been ignored; 
and (3) crosssectional dependence has rarely been allowed for. This paper aims to address these
three problems within a hierarchical panel data framework. We establish asymptotic properties for the proposed 
estimator, and apply the framework to a dataset of 23 manufacturing industries from a wide range of countries 
over the period 1963-2018. Our results show that both the manufacturing industry as a whole and
individual manufacturing industries at the ISIC two-digit level exhibit strong conditional convergence in 
labour productivity, but not unconditional convergence. In addition, our results show that both global and 
industry-specific shocks are important in explaining the convergence behaviours of the manufacturing industries.

Keywords: time-varying impulse response, parameter stability, instrumental variable approach
Abstract: Vector autoregressive (VAR) models are widely used in practical studies, e.g., forecasting, modelling 
policy transmission mechanism, and measuring connection of economic agents. To better capture the dynamics, 
this paper introduces a new class of time-varying VAR models in which the coefficients and covariance matrix 
of the error innovations are allowed to change smoothly over time. Accordingly, we establish a set of 
asymptotic properties including the impulse response analyses subject to structural VAR identification 
conditions, an information criterion to select the optimal lag, and a Wald-type test to determine the 
constant coefficients. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the theoretical findings. Finally, 
we demonstrate the empirical relevance and usefulness of the proposed methods through an application on US
government spending multipliers.

Keywords: Bayesian bootstrap, Dirichlet process, Huber loss, hypothesis testing, pathwise optimization
Abstract: Statistical hypotheses are translations of scientific hypotheses into statements about
one or more distributions, often concerning their center. Tests that assess statistical
hypotheses of center implicitly assume a specific center, e.g., the mean or median. Yet,
scientific hypotheses do not always specify a particular center. This ambiguity leaves
the possibility for a gap between scientific theory and statistical practice that can lead
to rejection of a true null. In the face of replicability crises in many scientific disciplines,
"significant results" of this kind are concerning. Rather than testing a single center,
this paper proposes testing a family of plausible centers, such as that induced by the
Huber loss function (the "Huber family"). Each center in the family generates a testing
problem, and the resulting family of hypotheses constitutes a familial hypothesis. A
Bayesian nonparametric procedure is devised to test familial hypotheses, enabled by a
pathwise optimization routine to fit the Huber family. The favorable properties of the
new test are verified through numerical simulation in one- and two-sample settings. Two
experiments from psychology serve as real-world case studies.

consistency, scoring rules
Abstract: Using theoretical and numerical results, we document the accuracy of commonly
applied variational Bayes methods across a range of state space models. The results
demonstrate that, in terms of accuracy on fixed parameters, there is a clear hierarchy
in terms of the methods, with approaches that do not approximate the states yielding
superior accuracy over methods that do. We also document numerically that the inferential 
discrepancies between the various methods often yield only small discrepancies
in predictive accuracy over small out-of-sample evaluation periods. Nevertheless, in
certain settings, these predictive discrepancies can become meaningful over a longer
out-of-sample period. This finding indicates that the invariance of predictive results
to inferential inaccuracy, which has been an oft-touted point made by practitioners seeking to 
justify the use of variational inference, is not ubiquitous and must be
assessed on a case-by-case basis.
