Abstract: Statistical hypotheses are translations of scientific hypotheses into statements about
one or more distributions, often concerning their center. Tests that assess statistical
hypotheses of center implicitly assume a specific center, e.g., the mean or median. Yet,
scientific hypotheses do not always specify a particular center. This ambiguity leaves
the possibility for a gap between scientific theory and statistical practice that can lead
to rejection of a true null. In the face of replicability crises in many scientific disciplines,
"significant results" of this kind are concerning. Rather than testing a single center,
this paper proposes testing a family of plausible centers, such as that induced by the
Huber loss function (the "Huber family"). Each center in the family generates a testing
problem, and the resulting family of hypotheses constitutes a familial hypothesis. A
Bayesian nonparametric procedure is devised to test familial hypotheses, enabled by a
pathwise optimization routine to fit the Huber family. The favorable properties of the
new test are verified through numerical simulation in one- and two-sample settings. Two
experiments from psychology serve as real-world case studies.

Abstract: Using theoretical and numerical results, we document the accuracy of commonly
applied variational Bayes methods across a range of state space models. The results
demonstrate that, in terms of accuracy on fixed parameters, there is a clear hierarchy
in terms of the methods, with approaches that do not approximate the states yielding
superior accuracy over methods that do. We also document numerically that the inferential 
discrepancies between the various methods often yield only small discrepancies
in predictive accuracy over small out-of-sample evaluation periods. Nevertheless, in
certain settings, these predictive discrepancies can become meaningful over a longer
out-of-sample period. This finding indicates that the invariance of predictive results
to inferential inaccuracy, which has been an oft-touted point made by practitioners seeking to 
justify the use of variational inference, is not ubiquitous and must be
assessed on a case-by-case basis.
