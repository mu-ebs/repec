Abstract: Forecast reconciliation is a post-forecasting process that involves transforming
a set of incoherent forecasts into coherent forecasts which satisfy a given set of
linear constraints for a multivariate time series. In this paper we extend the current 
state-of-the-art cross-sectional probabilistic forecast reconciliation approach
to encompass a cross-temporal framework, where temporal constraints are also
applied. Our proposed methodology employs both parametric Gaussian and
non-parametric bootstrap approaches to draw samples from an incoherent crosstemporal 
distribution. To improve the estimation of the forecast error covariance
matrix, we propose using multi-step residuals, especially in the time dimension
where the usual one-step residuals fail. To address high-dimensionality issues,
we present four alternatives for the covariance matrix, where we exploit the 
twofold nature (cross-sectional and temporal) of the cross-temporal structure, and
introduce the idea of overlapping residuals. We evaluate the proposed methods
through a detailed simulation study that investigates their theoretical and empirical 
properties. We further assess the effectiveness of the proposed cross-temporal
reconciliation approach by applying it to two empirical forecasting experiments,
using the Australian GDP and the Australian Tourism Demand datasets. For both
applications, we show that the optimal cross-temporal reconciliation approaches
significantly outperform the incoherent base forecasts in terms of the Continuous
Ranked Probability Score and the Energy Score. Overall, our study expands and
unifies the notation for cross-sectional, temporal and cross-temporal reconciliation, 
thus extending and deepening the probabilistic cross-temporal framework.
The results highlight the potential of the proposed cross-temporal forecast 
reconciliation methods in improving the accuracy of probabilistic forecasting models.

Abstract: This paper considers statistical inference of time-varying network vector autoregression models
for large-scale time series. A latent group structure is imposed on the heterogeneous and nodespecific 
time-varying momentum and network spillover effects so that the number of unknown
time-varying coefficients to be estimated can be reduced considerably. A classic agglomerative
clustering algorithm with normalized distance matrix estimates is combined with a generalized
information criterion to consistently estimate the latent group number and membership. A postgrouping 
local linear smoothing method is proposed to estimate the group-specific time-varying
momentum and network effects, substantially improving the convergence rates of the preliminary
estimates which ignore the latent structure. In addition, a post-grouping specification test is
conducted to verify the validity of the parametric model assumption for group-specific timevarying 
coefficient functions, and the asymptotic theory is derived for the test statistic constructed
via a kernel weighted quadratic form under the null and alternative hypotheses. Numerical studies
including Monte-Carlo simulation and an empirical application to the global trade flow data are
presented to examine the finite-sample performance of the developed model and methodology.

Abstract: Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), there have been multiple waves of infection and
multiple rounds of vaccination rollouts. Both prior infection and vaccination can prevent future infection
and reduce severity of outcomes, combining to form hybrid immunity against COVID-19 at the individual
and population level. Here, we explore how different combinations of hybrid immunity affect the size
and severity of near-future Omicron waves. To investigate the role of hybrid immunity, we use an agentbased 
model of COVID-19 transmission with waning immunity to simulate outbreaks in populations with varied past 
attack rates and past vaccine coverages, basing the demographics and past histories on the
World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region (WPR). We find that if the past infection
immunity is high but vaccination levels are low, then the secondary outbreak with the same variant
can occur within a few months after the first outbreak; meanwhile, high vaccination levels can suppress
near-term outbreaks and delay the second wave. Additionally, hybrid immunity has limited impact
on future COVID-19 waves with immune-escape variants. Enhanced understanding of the interplay
between infection and vaccine exposure can aid anticipation of future epidemic activity due to current
and emergent variants, including the likely impact of responsive vaccine interventions.

Keywords: additive single index models, generalized function, nonstationary time series,
quadratic approximation, regular function sequence, robust M–estimation
Abstract: Robust M-estimation uses loss functions, such as least absolute deviation (LAD), quantile
loss and Huber's loss, to construct its objective function, in order to for example eschew the
impact of outliers, whereas the difficulty in analysing the resultant estimators rests on the
nonsmoothness of these losses.

Generalized functions have advantages over ordinary functions in several aspects, especially
generalized functions possess derivatives of any order. Generalized functions incorporate local
integrable functions, the so-called regular generalized functions, while the so-called singular
generalized functions (e.g. Dirac delta function) can be obtained as the limits of a sequence
of sufficient smooth functions, so-called regular sequence in generalized function context. This
makes it possible to use these singular generalized functions through approximation. Nevertheless, 
a significant contribution of this paper is to establish the convergence rate of regular
sequence to nonsmooth loss that answers a call from the relevant literature.

For parameter estimation where objective function may be nonsmooth, this paper first shows
as a general paradigm that how generalized function approach can be used to tackle the nonsmooth 
loss functions in Section two using a very simple model. This approach is of general
interest and applicability. We further use the approach in robust M-estimation for additive
single–index cointegrating time series models; the asymptotic theory is established for the 
proposed estimators. We evaluate the finite–sample performance of the proposed estimation method
and theory by both simulated data and an empirical analysis of predictive regression of stock
returns.

computational methods, loss-based Bayesian prediction
Abstract: The Bayesian statistical paradigm provides a principled and coherent approach to probabilistic
forecasting. Uncertainty about all unknowns that characterize any forecasting problem -- model,
parameters, latent states -- is factored into the forecast distribution, with forecasts conditioned only
on what is known or observed. Allied with the elegance of the method, Bayesian forecasting is
now underpinned by the burgeoning field of Bayesian computation, which enables Bayesian forecasts
to be produced for virtually any problem, no matter how large, or complex. The current state of
play in Bayesian forecasting is the subject of this review. The aim is to provide readers with an
overview of modern approaches to the field, set in some historical context. Whilst our primary focus
is on applications in the fields of economics and finance, and their allied disciplines, sufficient general
details about implementation are provided to aid and inform all investigators.
