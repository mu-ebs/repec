Title: A High-dimensional Multinomial Logit Model

Abstract: The number of parameters in a standard multinomial logit model increases linearly
with the number of choice alternatives and number of explanatory variables. Since
many modern applications involve large choice sets with categorical explanatory
variables, which enter the model as large sets of binary dummies, the number of
parameters in a multinomial logit model is often large. This paper proposes a new
method for data-driven two-way parameter clustering over outcome categories and
explanatory dummy categories in a multinomial logit model. A Bayesian Dirichlet
process mixture model encourages parameters to cluster over the categories, which
reduces the number of unique model parameters and provides interpretable clusters
of categories. In an empirical application, we estimate the holiday preferences of 11
household types over 49 holiday destinations, and identify a small number of 
household segments with different preferences across clusters of holiday destinations.

rules, S&P500 forecasting, one-step versus two-step estimation
Abstract: The forecast combination puzzle is the commonly encountered empirical result
whereby predictions formed by combining multiple forecasts in complex ways do not
out-perform more naive, e.g. equally-weighted, approaches. While various solutions
for the cause of the puzzle exist in the literature, these solutions are limited in their
scope and applicability. In contrast, we demonstrate a general solution to the puzzle 
by showing that this phenomenon is a direct consequence of the methodology
used to produce forecast combinations. In particular, we show that tests which aim
to discriminate between the predictive accuracy of competing forecast combination
strategies have low power, and can lack size control, leading to an outcome that
favours the naive approach. In addition, we demonstrate that the low power of
such predictive accuracy tests in the forecast combination setting can be completely
avoided if more efficient strategies are used in the production of the combinations.
We illustrate these findings both in the context of forecasting a functional of interest
and in terms of predictive densities. A short empirical example using daily financial
returns exemplifies how researchers can avoid the puzzle in practical settings.

Abstract: This paper discusses the use of forecast reconciliation with stock price time series and the 
corresponding stock index. The individual stock price series may be grouped using known meta-data or other
clustering methods. We propose a novel forecasting framework that combines forecast reconciliation
and clustering, to lead to better forecasts of both the index and the individual stock price series. The
proposed approach is applied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index and its component stocks.
The results demonstrate empirically that reconciliation improves forecasts of the stock market index
and its constituents.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simple inferential method for a wide class of panel
data models with a focus on such cases that have both serial correlation and 
crosssectional dependence. In order to establish an asymptotic theory to support the
inferential method, we develop some new and useful higher-order expansions, such
as Berry-Esseen bound and Edgeworth Expansion, under a set of simple and general
conditions. We further demonstrate the usefulness of these theoretical results by
explicitly investigating a panel data model with interactive effects which nests many
traditional panel data models as special cases. Finally, we show the superiority of
our approach over several natural competitors using extensive numerical studies.

Abstract: The large heterogeneous panel data models are extended to the setting where 
the heterogenous coefficients are changing over time and the regressors are endogenous. 
Kernel-based non-parametric timevarying parameter instrumental variable mean group (TVP-IV-MG) 
estimator is proposed for the timevarying cross-sectional mean coefficients. The uniform 
consistency is shown and the pointwise asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator is 
derived. A data-driven bandwidth selection procedure is also
proposed. The finite sample performance of the proposed estimator is investigated through 
a Monte Carlo study and an empirical application on multi-country Phillips curve with 
time-varying parameters.

Abstract: This paper considers a time-varying vector error-correction model that allows 
for different time series behaviours (e.g., unit-root and locally stationary processes) 
to interact with
each other to co-exist. From practical perspectives, this framework can be used to estimate
shifts in the predictability of non-stationary variables, test whether economic theories hold
periodically, etc. We first develop a time-varying Granger Representation Theorem, which
facilitates the establishment of asymptotic properties for the model, and then propose 
estimation and inferential methods and theory for both short-run and long-run coefficients.
We also propose an information criterion to estimate the lag length, a singular-value ratio
test to determine the cointegration rank, and a hypothesis test to examine the parameter
stability. To validate the theoretical findings, we conduct extensive simulations. Finally, we
demonstrate the empirical relevance by applying the framework to investigate the rational
expectations hypothesis of the U.S. term structure.

Keywords: aggregation, coherence, cross-temporal, hierarchical time series, grouped time
series, temporal aggregation
Abstract: Collections of time series that are formed via aggregation are prevalent in many fields. These
are commonly referred to as hierarchical time series and may be constructed cross-sectionally
across different variables, temporally by aggregating a single series at different frequencies,
or may even be generalised beyond aggregation as time series that respect linear constraints.
When forecasting such time series, a desirable condition is for forecasts to be coherent, that
is to respect the constraints. The past decades have seen substantial growth in this field with
the development of reconciliation methods that not only ensure coherent forecasts but can
also improve forecast accuracy. This paper serves as both an encyclopaedic review of forecast
reconciliation and an entry point for researchers and practitioners dealing with hierarchical time
series. The scope of the article includes perspectives on forecast reconciliation from machine
learning, Bayesian statistics and probabilistic forecasting as well as applications in economics,
energy, tourism, retail demand and demography.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new bootstrap approach to the construction of confidence
regions for Average Treatment Effect (ATE) identified sets. Minimum Hausdorff
distance bootstrap confidence regions are developed and shown to be valid under
suitable regularity. A novel measure of the discrepancy between a confidence region
and the target identified set is advanced that contains two components analogous to
conventional hypothesis test Type I and Type II errors. Monte Carlo experimentation
is employed to compare the behaviour of the new confidence regions with an existing 
state of the art approach and the impact of different features on the properties
of the alternative techniques are investigated. Properties arising from the application
of quasi-maximum likelihood estimation as a tool for conducting inference on ATEs
are also examined.

Keywords: climate sensitivity, dynamic panel, varying-coefficient model, cointegration
Abstract: Global mean surface temperature has been increasing in response to growing greenhouse
gas concentrations (IPCC, 2021). While Earth is getting warmer overall, regions that differ in
local geographical features experience unequal increases in temperature. In this paper, we
develop a dynamic varying-coefficient panel data model and use it to measure regional climate
sensitivity, defined as the increase in temperature in that region, following a doubling of CO2
concentration. The inference method proposed in this paper is capable of accommodating
heterogeneous co-integrating relationships between global and local variables, and it allows 
comoving climate time series to possess both stochastic and deterministic trending components.
Using observational data of mean surface temperatures, solar radiation, and carbon dioxide
concentrations between 1959-2017, our model provides an estimate of a 3.7C increase for
average climate sensitivity. Moreover, our estimates indicate that high-latitude regions in the
Northern Hemisphere are most vulnerable to global warming.

Abstract: Forecast reconciliation is a post-forecasting process that involves transforming
a set of incoherent forecasts into coherent forecasts which satisfy a given set of
linear constraints for a multivariate time series. In this paper we extend the current 
state-of-the-art cross-sectional probabilistic forecast reconciliation approach
to encompass a cross-temporal framework, where temporal constraints are also
applied. Our proposed methodology employs both parametric Gaussian and
non-parametric bootstrap approaches to draw samples from an incoherent crosstemporal 
distribution. To improve the estimation of the forecast error covariance
matrix, we propose using multi-step residuals, especially in the time dimension
where the usual one-step residuals fail. To address high-dimensionality issues,
we present four alternatives for the covariance matrix, where we exploit the 
twofold nature (cross-sectional and temporal) of the cross-temporal structure, and
introduce the idea of overlapping residuals. We evaluate the proposed methods
through a detailed simulation study that investigates their theoretical and empirical 
properties. We further assess the effectiveness of the proposed cross-temporal
reconciliation approach by applying it to two empirical forecasting experiments,
using the Australian GDP and the Australian Tourism Demand datasets. For both
applications, we show that the optimal cross-temporal reconciliation approaches
significantly outperform the incoherent base forecasts in terms of the Continuous
Ranked Probability Score and the Energy Score. Overall, our study expands and
unifies the notation for cross-sectional, temporal and cross-temporal reconciliation, 
thus extending and deepening the probabilistic cross-temporal framework.
The results highlight the potential of the proposed cross-temporal forecast 
reconciliation methods in improving the accuracy of probabilistic forecasting models.

Keywords: cluster analysis, information criterion, latent groups, local linear estimator, network
VAR, time-varying coefficients
Abstract: This paper considers statistical inference of time-varying network vector autoregression models
for large-scale time series. A latent group structure is imposed on the heterogeneous and nodespecific 
time-varying momentum and network spillover effects so that the number of unknown
time-varying coefficients to be estimated can be reduced considerably. A classic agglomerative
clustering algorithm with normalized distance matrix estimates is combined with a generalized
information criterion to consistently estimate the latent group number and membership. A postgrouping 
local linear smoothing method is proposed to estimate the group-specific time-varying
momentum and network effects, substantially improving the convergence rates of the preliminary
estimates which ignore the latent structure. In addition, a post-grouping specification test is
conducted to verify the validity of the parametric model assumption for group-specific timevarying 
coefficient functions, and the asymptotic theory is derived for the test statistic constructed
via a kernel weighted quadratic form under the null and alternative hypotheses. Numerical studies
including Monte-Carlo simulation and an empirical application to the global trade flow data are
presented to examine the finite-sample performance of the developed model and methodology.

Keywords: epidemiology, mathematical modelling, vaccination, variants 
Abstract: Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), there have been multiple waves of infection and
multiple rounds of vaccination rollouts. Both prior infection and vaccination can prevent future infection
and reduce severity of outcomes, combining to form hybrid immunity against COVID-19 at the individual
and population level. Here, we explore how different combinations of hybrid immunity affect the size
and severity of near-future Omicron waves. To investigate the role of hybrid immunity, we use an agentbased 
model of COVID-19 transmission with waning immunity to simulate outbreaks in populations with varied past 
attack rates and past vaccine coverages, basing the demographics and past histories on the
World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region (WPR). We find that if the past infection
immunity is high but vaccination levels are low, then the secondary outbreak with the same variant
can occur within a few months after the first outbreak; meanwhile, high vaccination levels can suppress
near-term outbreaks and delay the second wave. Additionally, hybrid immunity has limited impact
on future COVID-19 waves with immune-escape variants. Enhanced understanding of the interplay
between infection and vaccine exposure can aid anticipation of future epidemic activity due to current
and emergent variants, including the likely impact of responsive vaccine interventions.

Abstract: Robust M-estimation uses loss functions, such as least absolute deviation (LAD), quantile
loss and Huber's loss, to construct its objective function, in order to for example eschew the
impact of outliers, whereas the difficulty in analysing the resultant estimators rests on the
nonsmoothness of these losses.

Generalized functions have advantages over ordinary functions in several aspects, especially
generalized functions possess derivatives of any order. Generalized functions incorporate local
integrable functions, the so-called regular generalized functions, while the so-called singular
generalized functions (e.g. Dirac delta function) can be obtained as the limits of a sequence
of sufficient smooth functions, so-called regular sequence in generalized function context. This
makes it possible to use these singular generalized functions through approximation. Nevertheless, 
a significant contribution of this paper is to establish the convergence rate of regular
sequence to nonsmooth loss that answers a call from the relevant literature.

For parameter estimation where objective function may be nonsmooth, this paper first shows
as a general paradigm that how generalized function approach can be used to tackle the nonsmooth 
loss functions in Section two using a very simple model. This approach is of general
interest and applicability. We further use the approach in robust M-estimation for additive
single–index cointegrating time series models; the asymptotic theory is established for the 
proposed estimators. We evaluate the finite–sample performance of the proposed estimation method
and theory by both simulated data and an empirical analysis of predictive regression of stock
returns.

computational methods, loss-based Bayesian prediction
Abstract: The Bayesian statistical paradigm provides a principled and coherent approach to probabilistic
forecasting. Uncertainty about all unknowns that characterize any forecasting problem -- model,
parameters, latent states -- is factored into the forecast distribution, with forecasts conditioned only
on what is known or observed. Allied with the elegance of the method, Bayesian forecasting is
now underpinned by the burgeoning field of Bayesian computation, which enables Bayesian forecasts
to be produced for virtually any problem, no matter how large, or complex. The current state of
play in Bayesian forecasting is the subject of this review. The aim is to provide readers with an
overview of modern approaches to the field, set in some historical context. Whilst our primary focus
is on applications in the fields of economics and finance, and their allied disciplines, sufficient general
details about implementation are provided to aid and inform all investigators.
