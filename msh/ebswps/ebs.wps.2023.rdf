Abstract: Robust M-estimation uses loss functions, such as least absolute deviation (LAD), quantile
loss and Huber’s loss, to construct its objective function, in order to for example eschew the
impact of outliers, whereas the difficulty in analysing the resultant estimators rests on the
nonsmoothness of these losses.

Generalized functions have advantages over ordinary functions in several aspects, especially
generalized functions possess derivatives of any order. Generalized functions incorporate local
integrable functions, the so-called regular generalized functions, while the so-called singular
generalized functions (e.g. Dirac delta function) can be obtained as the limits of a sequence
of sufficient smooth functions, so-called regular sequence in generalized function context. This
makes it possible to use these singular generalized functions through approximation. Nevertheless, 
a significant contribution of this paper is to establish the convergence rate of regular
sequence to nonsmooth loss that answers a call from the relevant literature.

For parameter estimation where objective function may be nonsmooth, this paper first shows
as a general paradigm that how generalized function approach can be used to tackle the nonsmooth 
loss functions in Section two using a very simple model. This approach is of general
interest and applicability. We further use the approach in robust M-estimation for additive
single–index cointegrating time series models; the asymptotic theory is established for the 
proposed estimators. We evaluate the finite–sample performance of the proposed estimation method
and theory by both simulated data and an empirical analysis of predictive regression of stock
returns.

Abstract: The Bayesian statistical paradigm provides a principled and coherent approach to probabilistic
forecasting. Uncertainty about all unknowns that characterize any forecasting problem -- model,
parameters, latent states -- is factored into the forecast distribution, with forecasts conditioned only
on what is known or observed. Allied with the elegance of the method, Bayesian forecasting is
now underpinned by the burgeoning field of Bayesian computation, which enables Bayesian forecasts
to be produced for virtually any problem, no matter how large, or complex. The current state of
play in Bayesian forecasting is the subject of this review. The aim is to provide readers with an
overview of modern approaches to the field, set in some historical context. Whilst our primary focus
is on applications in the fields of economics and finance, and their allied disciplines, sufficient general
details about implementation are provided to aid and inform all investigators.
