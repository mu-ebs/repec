Keywords: differentiated goods oligopoly, instruments, identification, cost data. 
Abstract: We propose a new methodology for estimating demand and cost functions of differentiated
products models when demand and cost data are available. The method deals with the
endogeneity of prices to demand shocks and the endogeneity of outputs to cost shocks by
using cost data. We establish identification, consistency and asymptotic normality of our
two-step Sieve Nonlinear Least Squares (SNLLS) estimator for the commonly used logit
and BLP demand function specification. Using Monte-Carlo experiments, we show that
our method works well in contexts where commonly used instruments are correlated with
demand and cost shocks and thus biased. We also apply our method to the estimation of
deposit demand in the US banking industry.

Keywords: method of moments, dynamic panel data, cross-sectional dependence, factor model. 
Abstract: This paper develops two instrumental variable (IV) estimators for dynamic panel data
models with exogenous covariates and a multifactor error structure when both crosssectional and 
time series dimensions, N and T respectively, are large. The main idea is to project out the 
common factors from the exogenous covariates of the model, and construct instruments based on 
defactored covariates. For models with homogeneous slope coefficients, we propose a two-step 
IV estimator: in the first step, the model is estimated consistently by employing defactored 
covariates as instruments. In the second step, the entire model is defactored based on estimated 
factors extracted from the residuals of the first step estimation; subsequently, an IV regression 
is implemented using the same instruments as in step one. For models with heterogeneous slope 
coefficients, we propose a mean-group type estimator, which involves averaging of first-step IV 
estimates of cross-section specific slopes. The proposed estimators do not need to seek for 
instrumental variables outside the model. Furthermore, these estimators are linear, thereby
computationally robust and inexpensive. Notably, they require no bias correction. The
finite sample performances of the proposed estimators and associated statistical tests are
investigated, and the results show that the estimators and the tests perform well even for
small N and T.

Keywords: factor model, high-dimensional data, principal component analysis, spiked empirical eigenvalue.
Abstract: This paper establishes asymptotic properties for spiked empirical eigenvalues of sample 
covariance matrices for high-dimensional data with both cross-sectional dependence and a dependent 
sample structure. A new finding from the established theoretical results is that spiked
empirical eigenvalues will reflect the dependent sample structure instead of the cross-sectional
structure under some scenarios, which indicates that principal component analysis (PCA) may
provide inaccurate inference for cross-sectional structures. An illustrated example is provided to
show that some commonly used statistics based on spiked empirical eigenvalues misestimate the
true number of common factors. As an application of high-dimensional time series, we propose a
test statistic to distinguish the unit root from the factor structure and demonstrate its effective
finite sample performance on simulated data. Our results are then applied to analyze OECD
healthcare expenditure data and U.S. mortality data, both of which possess cross-sectional
dependence as well as non-stationary temporal dependence. It is worth mentioning that we
contribute to statistical justification for the benchmark paper by Lee and Carter [25] in 
mortality forecasting.

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to hypothesis testing based on a vector of statistics.
It involves simulating the statistics under the null hypothesis and then estimating the joint
density of the statistics. This allows the p-value of the smallest acceptance region test to be
estimated. We prove this p-value is a consistent estimate under some regularity conditions. The
small-sample properties of the proposed procedure are investigated in the context of testing
for autocorrelation, testing for normality, and testing for model misspecification through the
information matrix. We find that our testing procedure has appropriate sizes and good powers.

Keywords: hierarchical forecasting, grouped forecasting, reconciling forecast, linear regression. 
Abstract: Forecasting hierarchical or grouped time series usually involves two steps: computing base
forecasts and reconciling the forecasts. Base forecasts can be computed by popular time series
forecasting methods such as Exponential Smoothing (ETS) and Autoregressive Integrated
Moving Average (ARIMA) models. The reconciliation step is a linear process that adjusts the
base forecasts to ensure they are coherent. However using ETS or ARIMA for base forecasts
can be computationally challenging when there are a large number of series to forecast, as each
model must be numerically optimized for each series. We propose a linear model that avoids
this computational problem and handles the forecasting and reconciliation in a single step. The
proposed method is very flexible in incorporating external data, handling missing values and
model selection. We illustrate our approach using two datasets: monthly Australian domestic
tourism and daily Wikipedia pageviews. We compare our approach to reconciliation using
ETS and ARIMA, and show that our approach is much faster while providing similar levels of
forecast accuracy.

Abstract: Income elasticity dynamics of health expenditure is considered for the OECD and
Eurozone over the period 1995-2014. Motivated by some modelling challenges, this
paper studies a class of non-linear cointegration panel data models, controlling
for cross-section dependence and certain endogeneity. Using the corresponding
methods, our empirical analyses show a slight increase in the income elasticity of
the healthcare expenditure over the years, but still with values under 1, meaning
that healthcare is not a luxury good in the OECD and Eurozone.

Abstract: Intermittent demand forecasting has been widely researched in the context of spare parts
management. However, it is becoming increasingly relevant to many other areas, such
as retailing, where at the very disaggregate level time series may be highly intermittent,
but at more aggregate levels are likely to exhibit trends and seasonal patterns. The vast
majority of intermittent demand forecasting methods are inappropriate of producing forecasts with such features. 
We propose using temporal hierarchies to produce forecasts that demonstrate these traits at the various 
aggregation levels, effectively informing the resulting intermittent forecasts of these patterns that are 
identifiable only at higher levels. We conduct an empirical evaluation on real data and demonstrate 
statistically significant gains for both point and quantile forecasts.

Keywords: concentrated quasi-maximum likelihood estimation, local linear estimation, time-varying coefficient.
Abstract: This paper develops a time-varying coefficient spatial autoregressive panel data model with the
individual fixed effects to capture the nonlinear effects of the regressors, which vary over the time.
To effectively estimate the model, we propose a method that incorporates the nonparametric local
linear method and the concentrated quasi-maximum likelihood estimation method to obtain consistent
estimators for the spatial coefficient and the time-varying coefficient function. The asymptotic properties
of these estimators are derived as well, showing the regular sqrt(NT)-rate of convergence for the parametric
parameters and the common sqrt(NTh)-rate of convergence for the nonparametric component, respectively.
Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to illustrate the finite sample performance of our proposed
method. Meanwhile, we apply our method to study the Chinese labor productivity to identify the
spatial influences and the time-varying spillover effects among 185 Chinese cities with comparison to the
results on a subregion East China.

Abstract: This paper studies a semiparametric single-index predictive regression model with
multiple nonstationary predictors that exhibit co-movement behaviour. Orthogonal series
expansion is employed to approximate the unknown link function in the model and the
estimator is derived from an optimization under constraint. The main finding includes
two types of super-consistency rates for the estimators of the index parameter. The
central limit theorem is established for a plug-in estimator of the unknown link function.
In the empirical studies, we provide ample evidence in favor of nonlinear predictability
of the stock return using four pairs of nonstationary predictors.

Keywords: cross-sectional dependence, duple LS iteration, endogeniety, nonparametric kernel estimation.
Abstract: Panel data subject to heterogeneity in both cross-sectional and time-serial directions are commonly 
encountered across social and scientific fields. To address this problem, we propose a class
of time-varying panel data models with individual-specific regression coefficients and interactive
common factors. This results in a model capable of describing heterogeneous panel data in terms
of time-varyingness in the time-serial direction and individual-specific coefficients among crosssections. 
Another striking generality of this proposed model relies on its compatibility with endogeneity in the sense 
of interactive common factors. Model estimation is achieved through a novel
duple least-squares (DLS) iteration algorithm, which implements two least-squares estimation recursively. Its 
unified ability in estimation is nicely illustrated according to flexible applications on
various cases with exogenous or endogenous common factors. Established asymptotic theory for
DLS estimators benefits practitioners by demonstrating effectiveness of iteration in eliminating estimation 
bias gradually along with iterative steps. We further show that our model and estimation
perform well on simulated data in various scenarios as well as an OECD healthcare expenditure
dataset. The time-variation and heterogeneity among cross-sections are confirmed by our analysis.

Abstract: We propose a common features approach and establish that global temperatures and 
greenhouse gases share a common trend without conditioning on the
exact nature of their trends. We also find deterministic cycles in global temperature series 
with a period of 72 years whose amplitude is non-negligible compared
to the warming effect caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. We also
explore the direction of causation in the co-trending relationship by establishing
an error correction mechanism, which shows that greenhouse gas emissions do
not respond to the equilibrium errors whereas the global temperature responds
to equilibrium errors so as to maintain the co-trending relationship. Finally, we
forecast future temperatures conditional on representative concentration pathways (RCP) of 
greenhouse gases considered by the intergovernmental panel on
climate change (IPCC). Our forecasts show that the cyclical component could
play a significant role in the next 30 years in such a way that would make the
politics of effective emission control policy making more challenging.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of filter choice on forecast accuracy in state space models. The filters
are used both to estimate the posterior distribution of the parameters, via a particle marginal
Metropolis-Hastings (PMMH) algorithm, and to produce draws from the filtered distribution of
the final state. Multiple filters are entertained, including two new data-driven methods. Simulation
exercises are used to document the performance of each PMMH algorithm, in terms of computation
time and the efficiency of the chain. We then produce the forecast distributions for the one-stepahead 
value of the observed variable, using a fixed number of particles and Markov chain draws.
Despite distinct differences in efficiency, the filters yield virtually identical forecasting accuracy,
with this result holding under both correct and incorrect specification of the model. This invariance
of forecast performance to the specification of the filter also characterizes an empirical analysis of
S&P500 daily returns.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel meta-learning algorithm for time series forecasting. The efficient
Bayesian multivariate surface regression approach is used to model forecast error as a function
of features calculated from the time series. The minimum predicted forecast error is then used
to identify an individual model or combination of models to produce forecasts. In general, the
performance of any meta-learner strongly depends on the reference dataset used to train the
model. We further examine the feasibility of using GRATIS (a feature-based time series simulation approach)
in generating a realistic time series collection to obtain a diverse collection of time
series for our reference set. The proposed framework is tested using the M4 competition data
and is compared against several benchmarks and other commonly used forecasting approaches.
The new approach obtains performance comparable to the second and the third rankings of the
M4 competition.

Abstract: The HDoutliers algorithm is a powerful unsupervised algorithm for detecting anomalies in
high-dimensional data, with a strong theoretical foundation. However, it suffers from some
limitations that significantly hinder its performance level, under certain circumstances. In
this article, we propose an algorithm that addresses these limitations. We define an anomaly
as an observation that deviates markedly from the majority with a large distance gap. An
approach based on extreme value theory is used for the anomalous threshold calculation. Using
various synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate the wide applicability and usefulness of
our algorithm, which we call the stray algorithm. We also demonstrate how this algorithm
can assist in detecting anomalies present in other data structures using feature engineering. We
show the situations where the stray algorithm outperforms the HDoutliers algorithm both in
accuracy and computational time. This framework is implemented in the open source R package
stray.

Keywords: large choice sets, Dirichlet process prior, multinomial probit model, high-dimensional models 
Abstract: The number of parameters in a standard multinomial choice model increases linearly with the number of choice alternatives and number of 
explanatory variables. Since many modern applications involve large choice sets with categorical explanatory variables, which enter the model as 
large sets of binary dummies, the number of parameters easily approaches the sample size. This paper proposes a new method for data-driven parameter
clustering over outcome categories and explanatory dummy categories in a multinomial probit setting. A Dirichlet process mixture encourages 
parameters to cluster over the categories, which favours a parsimonious model specification without a priori imposing model restrictions. 
An application to a dataset of holiday destinations shows a decrease in parameter uncertainty, an enhancement of the parameter interpretability, 
and an increase in predictive performance, relative to a standard multinomial choice model.

Abstract: A geometric interpretation is developed for so-called reconciliation 
methodologies used to forecast time series that adhere to known linear constraints. 
In particular, a general framework is established nesting many existing popular 
reconciliation methods within the class of projections. This interpretation 
facilitates the derivation of novel results that explain why and how reconciliation 
via projection is guaranteed to improve forecast accuracy with respect to 
a specific class of loss functions. The result is also demonstrated empirically. 
The geometric interpretation is further used to provide a new proof that 
forecast reconciliation results in unbiased forecasts provided the initial base 
forecasts are also unbiased. Approaches for dealing with biased base forecasts 
are proposed and explored in an extensive empirical study on Australian tourism flows. 
Overall, the method of bias-correcting before carrying out reconciliation 
is shown to outperform alternatives that only bias-correct or only reconcile forecasts.

Abstract: This paper introduces DOBIN, a new approach to select a set of basis vectors 
tailored for outlier detection. DOBIN has a solid mathematical foundation and can be used 
as a dimension reduction tool for outlier detection tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness 
of DOBIN on an extensive data repository, by comparing the performance of outlier detection 
methods using DOBIN and other bases. We further illustrate the utility of DOBIN as an 
outlier visualization tool. The R package dobin implements this basis construction.

Abstract: Functional autoregressive models are popular for functional time series analysis, but the standard formulation fails to address 
seasonal behaviour in functional time series data. To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce seasonal functional autoregressive time 
series models. For the model of order one, we derive sufficient stationarity conditions and limiting behavior, and provide estimation 
and prediction methods. Some properties of the general order P model are also presented. The merits of these models are demonstrated 
using simulation studies and via an application to real data.

Keywords: aggregation, Australian tourism, coherent forecasts, contemporaneous error correlation, 
forecast combinations, least squares, non-negative, spatial correlations, reconciliation.
Abstract: The sum of forecasts of a disaggregated time series are often required to equal the forecast of
the aggregate. The least squares solution for finding coherent forecasts uses a reconciliation
approach known as MinT, proposed by Wickramasuriya, Athanasopoulos and Hyndman (2019).
The MinT approach and its variants do not guarantee that the coherent forecasts are nonnegative, 
even when all of the original forecasts are non-negative in nature. This has become a
serious issue in applications that are inherently non-negative such as with sales data or tourism
numbers. While overcoming this difficulty, we consider the analytical solution of MinT as a
least squares minimization problem. The non-negativity constraints are then imposed on the
minimization problem to ensure that the coherent forecasts are strictly non-negative.
Considering the dimension and sparsity of the matrices involved, and the alternative representation 
of MinT, this constrained quadratic programming problem is solved using three algorithms.
They are the block principal pivoting algorithm, projected conjugate gradient algorithm, and
scaled gradient projection algorithm. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed to evaluate the
computational performances of these algorithms. The results demonstrate that the block principal 
pivoting algorithm clearly outperforms the rest, and projected conjugate gradient is the
second best. The superior performance of the block principal pivoting algorithm can be partially
attributed to the alternative representation of the weight matrix in the MinT approach.
An empirical investigation is carried out to assess the impact of imposing non-negativity
constraints on forecast reconciliation. It is observed that slight gains in forecast accuracy have
occurred at the most disaggregated level. At the aggregated level slight losses are also observed.
Although the gains or losses are negligible, the procedure plays an important role in decision
and policy implementation processes.

Abstract: This paper conducts an extensive forecasting study on 13,118 time series measuring Swiss goods exports, grouped hierarchically by export destination and product
category. We apply existing state of the art methods in forecast reconciliation and
introduce a novel Bayesian reconciliation framework. This approach allows for explicit
estimation of reconciliation biases, leading to several innovations: Prior judgment can
be used to assign weights to specific forecasts and the occurrence of negative reconciled
forecasts can be ruled out. Overall we find strong evidence that in addition to producing coherent forecasts, reconciliation also leads to improvements in forecast accuracy.

Keywords: importance sampling, forecasting, clustering, Dirichlet process mixture, variational inference 
Abstract: Variational Bayesian (VB) methods usually produce posterior inference in a time frame considerably 
smaller than traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches. Although the VB posterior is an approximation, 
it has been shown to produce good parameter estimates and predicted values when a rich class of approximating 
distributions are considered. In this paper we propose Updating VB (UVB), a recursive algorithm used to update a sequence of VB posterior approximations in an online setting, with the computation of each posterior update requiring only the data observed since the previous update. An extension to the proposed algorithm, named UVB-IS, allows the user to trade accuracy for a substantial increase in computational speed through the use of importance sampling. The two methods and their properties are detailed in two separate simulation studies. Two empirical illustrations of the proposed UVB
methods are provided, including one where a Dirichlet Process Mixture model is repeatedly updated in the 
context of predicting the future behaviour of vehicles on a stretch of the US Highway 101.

Abstract: Mining temporal data for information is often inhibited by a multitude of formats: irregular
or multiple time intervals, point events that need aggregating, multiple observational units or
repeated measurements on multiple individuals, and heterogeneous data types. On the other
hand, the software supporting time series modeling and forecasting, makes strict assumptions
on the data to be provided, typically requiring a matrix of numeric data with implicit time
indexes. Going from raw data to model-ready data is painful. This work presents a cohesive
and conceptual framework for organizing and manipulating temporal data, which in turn flows
into visualization, modeling and forecasting routines. Tidy data principles are extended to
temporal data by: (1) mapping the semantics of a dataset into its physical layout; (2) including
an explicitly declared index variable representing time; (3) incorporating a "key" comprising
single or multiple variables to uniquely identify units over time. This tidy data representation
most naturally supports thinking of operations on the data as building blocks, forming part of a
"data pipeline" in time-based contexts. A sound data pipeline facilitates a fluent workflow for
analyzing temporal data. The infrastructure of tidy temporal data has been implemented in the
R package tsibble.

Abstract: Calendars are broadly used in society to display temporal information and events. This paper
describes a new calendar display for plotting data, that includes a layout algorithm with many
options, and faceting functionality. The functions use modulus algebra on the date variable
to restructure the data into a calendar format. The user can apply the grammar of graphics to
create plots inside each calendar cell, and thus the displays synchronize neatly with ggplot2
graphics. The motivating application is studying pedestrian behavior in Melbourne, Australia,
based on counts which are captured at hourly intervals by sensors scattered around the city.
Faceting by the usual features such as day and month, is insufficient to examine the behavior.
Making displays on a monthly calendar format helps to understand pedestrian patterns relative
to events such as work days, weekends, holidays, and special events. The functions for the
calendar algorithm are available in the R package sugrrants.

where y(t) = (y(t1),...,y(tp)) and &#931;&#94;(1/2) is the square root of a symmetric positive definite
matrix. Here &#966;&#8804;1 and T(1-&#966;) is bounded and the linear processes y(tj) is of the
form &#931;b(k)z(t-k,j) where &#931;|bi| &#60; infinity and {z(ij)} are independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with E(z(ij))=0, E|z(ij)|&#94;2=1 and E|z(ij)|&#94;4&#60; infinity.
We first investigate the asymptotic behavior of the first k largest eigenvalues of the
sample covariance matrices of the time series model. We then propose an estimator of
&#966; and use it to test for near unit roots. Simulations and empirical applications are also
conducted to demonstrate the performance of the statistic.

Keywords: cross-sectional dependence, factor model, joint estimation, large panel data analysis, marginal estimation.
Abstract: Accurate estimation for extent of cross-sectional dependence in large panel data analysis is paramount 
to further statistical analysis on the data under study. Grouping more data with weak relations (cross-sectional dependence) 
together often results in less efficient dimension reduction and worse forecasting. This paper describes cross-sectional 
dependence among a large number of objects (time series) via a factor model and parametrizes its extent in terms of 
strength of factor loadings. A new joint estimation method, benefiting from unique feature of dimension reduction for 
high dimensional time series, is proposed for the parameter representing the extent and some other parameters involved
in the estimation procedure. Moreover, a joint asymptotic distribution for a pair of estimators is established. 
Simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation method in the finite sample performance. 
Applications in cross-country macro-variables and stock returns from S&P 500 are studied.

Abstract: We examine the relationships between electoral socio-demographic characteristics and two-party
preference in the six Australian federal elections held between 2001 to 2016. Socio-demographic
information is derived from the Australian Census, which occurs every five years. Since a
Census is not directly available for each election, spatio-temporal imputation is employed to
estimate Census data for the electorates at the time of each election. This accounts for both
spatial and temporal changes in electoral characteristics between Censuses. To capture any
spatial heterogeneity, a spatial error model is estimated for each election, which incorporates
a spatially structured random effect vector that can be thought of as the unobserved political
climate in each electorate. Over time, the impact of most socio-demographic characteristics that
affect electoral two-party preference do not vary, with industry of work, incomes, household
mobility and de facto relationships having strong effects in each of the six elections. Education
and unemployment are amongst those that have varying effects. It is also found that between
2004 and 2013, the spatial effect was insignificant, meaning that electorates voted effectively
independently. All data featured in this study has been contributed to the eechidna R package
(available on CRAN).

Abstract: We use the jackknife to bias correct the log-periodogram regression (LPR) estimator of the
fractional parameter in a stationary fractionally integrated model. The weights for the jackknife
estimator are chosen in such a way that bias reduction is achieved without the usual increase in
asymptotic variance, with the estimator viewed as `optimal' in this sense. The theoretical results
are valid under both the non-overlapping and moving-block sub-sampling schemes that can be used
in the jackknife technique, and do not require the assumption of Gaussianity for the data generating
process. A Monte Carlo study explores the Önite sample performance of di§erent versions of the
optimal jackknife estimator under a variety of fractional data generating processes. The simulations
reveal that when the weights are constructed using the true parameter values, a version of the
optimal jackknife estimator almost always out-performs alternative bias-corrected estimators. A
feasible version of the jackknife estimator, in which the weights are constructed using consistent
estimators of the unknown parameters, whilst not dominant overall, is still the least biased estimator
in some cases.

Keywords: growth regressions, variable selection, parameter heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence.
Abstract: Empirical growth analysis has three major problems -- variable selection, parameter heterogeneity 
and cross-sectional dependence -- which are addressed independently from each other in most studies. The 
purpose of this study is to propose an integrated framework that extends the conventional linear growth regression
model to allow for parameter heterogeneity and cross-sectional error dependence, while simultaneously performing 
variable selection. We also derive the asymptotic properties of the estimator under both low and high dimensions, 
and furtherinvestigate the finite sample performance of the estimator through Monte Carlo
simulations. We apply the framework to a dataset of 89 countries over the period
from 1960 to 2014. Our results reveal some cross-country patterns not found in
previous studies (e.g., "middle income trap hypothesis", "natural resources curse
hypothesis", "religion works via belief, not practice", etc.).

Abstract: We propose two new nonparametric predictive models: the multi-step nonparametric
predictive regression model and the multi-step additive predictive regression model, in which
the predictive variables are locally stationary time series. We define estimation methods and
establish the large sample properties of these methods in the short horizon and the long
horizon case. We apply our methods to stock return prediction using a number of standard
predictors such as dividend yield. The empirical results show that all of these models can
substantially outperform the traditional linear predictive regression model in terms of both
in-sample and out-of-sample performance. In addition, we find that these models can always
beat the historical mean model in terms of in-sample fitting, and also for some cases in
terms of the out-of-sample forecasting. We also propose a trading strategy based on our
methodology and show that it beats the buy and hold stategy provided the tuning parameters
are well chosen.

apply forecast reconciliation methods to generate forecasts that are coherent with the aggregation constraints. 
We generate both point and probabilistic forecasts for the first time in the
macroeconomic setting. Using Australian GDP we show that forecast reconciliation not only
returns coherent forecasts but also improves the overall forecast accuracy in both point and
probabilistic frameworks.

Abstract: Outliers due to technical errors in water-quality data from in situ sensors can reduce data
quality and have a direct impact on inference drawn from subsequent data analysis. However,
outlier detection through manual monitoring is unfeasible given the volume and velocity of
data the sensors produce. Here, we proposed an automated framework that provides early
detection of outliers in water-quality data from in situ sensors caused by technical issues.The
framework was used first to identify the data features that differentiate outlying instances
from typical behaviours. Then statistical transformations were applied to make the outlying
instances stand out in transformed data space. Unsupervised outlier scoring techniques were
then applied to the transformed data space and an approach based on extreme value theory
was used to calculate a threshold for each potential outlier. Using two data sets obtained from
in situ sensors in rivers flowing into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, Australia, we showed that
the proposed framework successfully identified outliers involving abrupt changes in turbidity,
conductivity and river level, including sudden spikes, sudden isolated drops and level shifts,
while maintaining very low false detection rates. We implemented this framework in the open
source R package oddwater.
