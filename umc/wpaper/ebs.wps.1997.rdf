length: 15 pages
abstract: The paper is concerned with the analysis of strike data in which the 
    distribution of short strikes differs from that of long strikes. It appears 
    through visual inspection and asymptotic prodecures that for Israeli strikers 
    in the years 1965-1992, the hazard function is exponential for strikes lasting 
    less than 40 days and that it is Weibull with a Weibull parameter greater than 
    unity for longer strikes.

keywords: STATISTICS ; ECONOMETRICS
length: 32 pages
abstract: The concept of fractional cointegration, whereby deviations from an 
    equilibrium relationship follow a fractionally integrated process, has attracted 
    some attention of late. The extended concept allows cointegration to be 
    associated with mean reversion in the error, rather than requiring the more 
    stringent condition of stationarity. The paper presents a Bayesian method for 
    conducting inference about fractional cointegration.

abstract: The problem of constructing prediction intervals for linear time series 
    (ARIMA) models is examined. The aim is to find prediction intervals which 
    incorporate an allowance for sampling error associated with parameter estimates. 
    The effect of constraints on parameters arising from stationary and 
    invertibility conditions is also incorporated. Two new methods, based to 
    varying degrees on first-order Taylor approximations, are proposed.

abstract: The global linear trend with autocorrelated disturbances is a surprising 
    omission from the M1 competition. This approach to forecasting is therefore 
    evaluated using the 51 non-seasonal series from the competition. It is 
    contrasted with a fully optimized version of Holts trend corrected exponential 
    smoothing. It is found that an adaptation of Holts method, in which the growth 
    rate is restricted to be constant, performs almost as well as its traditional 
    counterpart and usually out-performs the global linear trend with autoregressive 
    disturbances.

    a parametric or nonparametric manner, significant variables can be identified 
    from a large number of potential regressors and an appropriate transformation 
    of the dependent variable can be automatically selected from a discrete set of 
    pre-specified candidate transformations.

    develop two Bayesian approaches for segmenting a time series, namely the Bayes 
    Factor approach, and the Minimum Message Length (MML) approach. We perform 
    simulations comparing these Bayesian approaches, and then perform a comparison 
    with other classical approaches, namely AIC, MDL and BIC.
