Abstract: We looked at evidence from comparative empirical studies to identify methods that can be useful for predicting demand in various situations and to warn against methods that should not be used. In general, use structured methods and avoid intuition, unstructured meetings, focus groups, and data mining. In situations where there are sufficient data, use quantitative methods including extrapolation, quantitative analogies, rule-based forecasting, and causal methods. Otherwise, use methods that structure judgement including surveys of intentions and expectations, judgmental bootstrapping, structured analogies, and simulated interaction. Managers' domain knowledge should be incorporated into statistical forecasts. Methods for combining forecasts, including Delphi and prediction markets, improve accuracy. We provide guidelines for the effective use of forecasts, including such procedures as scenarios. Few organizations use many of the methods described in this paper. Thus, there are opportunities to improve efficiency by adopting these forecasting practices.

Abstract: This paper examines the linkage of real interest rates of a group of Pacific-Basin countries with a focus on East Asia. We consider monthly real interest rates of the US, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Thailand from 1980 and 2004. The impulse response analysis and half-life estimation are conducted in a multivariate setting, adopting the bias-corrected bootstrap as a means of statistical inference. It is found that the degree of capital market integration has increased after the Asian financial crisis in 1997. The evidence suggests that the crisis has substantially changed the nature of the short run interactions among the real interest rates. Before the crisis, both the US and Japanese capital markets dominated the region. However, after the crisis, the dominance of the Japanese market has completely disappeared, while the US remains as a sole dominant player.

Keywords: Volatility Transmission, Vector Autoregressive Model, Impulse Response Analysis, Bootstrap
Abstract: Fluctuations in commodity prices are a major concern to many market participants.  This paper uses realized volatility methods to calculate daily volatility and correlation estimates for three grain futures prices (corn, soybean and wheat). The realized volatility estimates exhibit the properties consistent with the stylized facts observed in earlier studies. According to the realized correlations and regression coefficients, the spot returns from the three grain futures are positively related. The realized estimates are then used to evaluate the degree of volatility transmissions across grain future prices. The impulse response analysis is conducted by fitting the vector autoregressive model to realized volatility and correlation estimates, using the bootstrap method for statistical inference. The results indicate that there exist rich dynamic interactions among the volatilities and correlations across the grain futures markets.

Keywords: Similar tests, consistent tests, weak instruments, identification
Abstract: It is well known that confidence intervals for weakly identified parameters are unbounded with positive probability (e.g. Dufour, Econometrica 65, pp. 1365-1387 and Staiger and Stock, Econometrica 65, pp. 557-586), and that the asymptotic risk of their estimators is unbounded (Pötscher, Econometrica 70, pp.1035-1065). In this note we extend these "impossibility results" and show that uniformly consistent tests for weakly identified parameters do not exist. We also show that all similar tests of size a < 1/2 concerning possibly unidentified parameters have type II error probability that can be as large as 1 - a.

Keywords: Linear Regression Model, Similar Tests, Invariant Tests, Structural Change, Weighted Average Power Tests, Laplace Approximation, Uniform Laplace Approximation.
Abstract: The average exponential tests for structural change of Andrews and Ploberger (Econometrica, 62, 1994) and Andrews, Lee and Ploberger (Journal of Econometrics 70, 1996) and modifications thereof maximize a weighted average power which incorporates specific weighting functions in order to make the resulting test statistics simple. Generalizations of these tests involve the numerical evaluation of (potentially) complicated integrals. In this paper we suggest a uniform Laplace approximation to evaluate weighted average power test statistics for which a simple closed form does not exist. We also show that a modification of the avg-F test is optimal under a very large class of weighting functions and can be written as a ratio of quadratic forms. Finally, we discuss how the computational burden of averaging over all possible change-points can be addressed.

Abstract: In the context of a general regression model in which some regression coefficients are of interest and others are purely nuisance parameters, we derive the density function of a maximal invariant statistic with the aim of testing for the inclusion of regressors (either linear or non-linear) in linear or semi-linear models. This allows the construction of the locally best invariant test, which in two important cases is equivalent to the one-sided t-test for a regression coefficient in an artificial linear regression model.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of estimation of semi-linear regression models.  Using invariance arguments, Bhowmik and King (2001) have derived the probability density functions of the maximal invariant statistic for the nonlinear component of these models. Using these density functions as likelihood functions allows us to estimate these models in a two-step process. First the nonlinear component parameters are estimated by maximising the maximal invariant likelihood function. Then the nonlinear component, with the parameter values replaced by estimates, is treated as a regressor and ordinary least squares is used to estimate the remaining parameters. We report the results of a simulation study conducted to compare the accuracy of this approach with full maximum likelihood estimation. We find maximising the maximal invariant likelihood function typically results in less biased and lower variance estimates than those from full maximum likelihood.

Keywords: Competition, Market Share, Objectives, Profitability.
Abstract: Competitor-oriented objectives, such as market-share targets, are promoted by academics and are common in business. A 1996 review of the evidence indicated that this violation of economic theory led to reduced profitability. We summarize the evidence as of 1996 then describe evidence from 12 new studies. All of the evidence supports the conclusion that competitor-oriented objectives are harmful. However, this evidence has had only a modest impact on academic research and it seems to be largely ignored by managers. Until this situation changes, we expect that many firms will continue to use competitor-oriented objectives to the detriment of their profitability.

Keywords: Autoregression, Autoregressive approximation, Fractional process, Non-invertibility, Order selection, Asymptotic efficiency.
Abstract: Autoregressive models are commonly employed to analyze empirical time series. In practice, however, any autoregressive model will only be an approximation to reality and in order to achieve a reasonable approximation and allow for full generality the order of the autoregression, h say, must be allowed to go to infinity with T, the sample size. Although results are available on the estimation of autoregressive models when h increases indefinitely with T such results are usually predicated on assumptions that exclude (i) non-invertible processes and (ii) fractionally integrated processes. In this paper we will investigate the consequences of fitting long autoregressions under regularity conditions that allow for these two situations and where an infinite autoregressive representation of the process need not exist. Uniform convergence rates for the sample autocovariances are derived and corresponding convergence rates for the estimates of AR(h) approximations are established. A central limit theorem for the coefficient estimates is also obtained. An extension of a result on the predictive optimality of AIC to fractional and non-invertible processes is obtained.

Keywords: Reduced rank models, model selection criteria, forecasting accuracy.
Abstract: Using vector autoregressive (VAR) models and Monte-Carlo simulation methods we investigate the potential gains for forecasting accuracy and estimation uncertainty of two commonly used restrictions arising from economic relationships. The first reduces parameter space by imposing long-term restrictions on the behavior of economic variables as discussed by the literature on cointegration, and the second reduces parameter space by imposing short-term restrictions as discussed by the literature on serial-correlation common features (SCCF). Our simulations cover three important issues on model building, estimation, and forecasting. First, we examine the performance of standard and modified information criteria in choosing lag length for cointegrated VARs with SCCF restrictions. Second, we provide a comparison of forecasting accuracy of .fitted VARs when only cointegration restrictions are imposed and when cointegration and SCCF restrictions are jointly imposed. Third, we propose a new estimation algorithm where short- and long-term restrictions interact to estimate the cointegrating and the cofeature spaces respectively.  We have three basic results. First, ignoring SCCF restrictions has a high cost in terms of model selection, because standard information criteria chooses too frequently inconsistent models, with too small a lag length. Criteria selecting lag and rank simultaneously have a superior performance in this case. Second, this translates into a superior forecasting performance of the restricted VECM over the VECM, with important improvements in forecasting accuracy .reaching more than 100% in extreme cases. Third, the new algorithm proposed here fares very well in terms of parameter estimation, even when we consider the estimation of long-term parameters, opening up the discussion of joint estimation of short- and long-term parameters in VAR models.

Abstract: We discuss and compare measures of accuracy of univariate time series forecasts. The methods used in the M-competition and the M3-competition, and many of the measures recommended by previous authors on this topic, are found to be inadequate, and many of them are degenerate in commonly occurring situations. Instead, we propose that the mean absolute scaled error become the standard measure for comparing forecast accuracy across multiple time series.

Abstract: We review the past 25 years of time series research that has been published in journals managed by the International Institute of Forecasters (Journal of Forecasting 1982-1985; International Journal of Forecasting 1985-2005). During this period, over one third of all papers published in these journals concerned time series forecasting. We also review highly influential works on time series forecasting that have been published elsewhere during this period. Enormous progress has been made in many areas, but we find that there are a large number of topics in need of further development. We conclude with comments on possible future research directions in this field.

Keywords: Beta, Downside risk, Emerging markets
Abstract: Several studies advocating safety first as a major concern to investors propose downside beta risk as an alternative to the traditional systematic risk-beta. Downside measures are concerned with a subset of the data and therefore the results in the studies that consider the downside beta only may be biased. This study addresses this issue by including downside co-skewness risk in addition to the downside beta risk in the pricing model. In a sample of 27 emerging markets two-stage rolling regression analysis fails to support pricing models with downside risk measures. In a cross-sectional analysis inclusion of downside co-skewness improves model fit. When considered together, downside beta is potential and downside co-skewness is a risk to the rational investor.  Even though our results are inconclusive the evidence strongly suggests a need for further investigation of co-skewness risk in pricing models that adopt a downside risk framework.

For the majority of trading zones there is little trading activity that occurs. There are three trading zones in which the markets for temporary water rights are reasonably active and liquid on a weekly basis, and for these zones an analysis is conducted of their demand and supply elasticities and consumer and producer surplus. The results of this analysis suggest a stronger relationship on the supply side between prices, volumes, elasticity and producer surplus.

Keywords: Sovereign Ratings, Ordered Response Models, Case-Based Reasoning
Abstract: The paper compares two alternative techniques for the modelling of the determinants of sovereign ratings, specifically, ordered probit and case-based reasoning. Despite the differences in approach the two alternative modelling approaches produce similar results in terms of which variables are significant and forecast accuracy. This suggests that either approach can be used, and that there is some robustness in the results. As regards significant variables, both models find that a proxy for technological development, specifically, mobile phone use, is the most important variable. Apart from the technology proxy, a range of conventional macroeconomic variables are found to be significant, in particular GDP and inflation. The models are then used to produce forecasts for 2002 and for a set of unrated countries. The forecast comparison indicates the critical role played by the technology proxy variable in the modelling.

Abstract: New results for ratios of extremes from distributions with a regularly varying tail are presented. Deriving from independence results for certain functions of order statistics, 'consecutive' ratios of extremes are shown to be independent as well as non-distribution specific. They have tractable distributions related to beta distributions.
The minimum variance unbiased maximum likelihood estimator has the form of Hill's estimator. It achieves the Cramer-Rao minimum variance bound and is a function of a sufficient statistic. For small sample sizes the form of the moment generating function of the estimator shows it has a gamma distribution.

Abstract: The state space approach to modelling univariate time series is now widely used both in theory and in applications. However, the very richness of the framework means that quite different model formulations are possible, even when they purport to describe the same phenomena. In this paper, we examine the single source of error [SSOE] scheme, which has perfectly correlated error components. We then proceed to compare SSOE to the more common version of the state space models, for which all the error terms are independent; we refer to this as the multiple source of error [MSOE] scheme.  As expected, there are many similarities between the MSOE and SSOE schemes, but also some important differences. Both have ARIMA models as their reduced forms, although the mapping is more transparent for SSOE. Further, SSOE does not require a canonical form to complete its specification. An appealing feature of SSOE is that the estimates of the state variables converge in probability to their true values, thereby leading to a formal inferential structure for the ad-hoc exponential smoothing methods for forecasting. The parameter space for SSOE models may be specified to match that of the corresponding ARIMA scheme, or it may be restricted to meaningful sub-spaces, as for MSOE but with somewhat different outcomes.  The SSOE formulation enables straightforward extensions to certain classes of non-linear models, including a linear trend with multiplicative seasonals version that underlies the Holt-Winters forecasting method.  Conditionally heteroscedastic models may be developed in a similar manner. Finally we note that smoothing and decomposition, two crucial practical issues, may be performed within the SSOE framework.

Abstract: Applications of exponential smoothing to forecast time series usually rely on three basic methods: simple exponential smoothing, trend corrected exponential smoothing and a seasonal variation thereof. A common approach to select the method appropriate to a particular time series is based on prediction validation on a withheld part of the sample using criteria such as the mean absolute percentage error. A second approach is to rely on the most appropriate general case of the three methods.  For annual series this is trend corrected exponential smoothing: for sub-annual series it is the seasonal adaptation of trend corrected exponential smoothing. The rationale for this approach is that a general method automatically collapses to its nested counterparts when the pertinent conditions pertain in the data.  A third approach may be based on an information criterion when maximum likelihood methods are used in conjunction with exponential smoothing to estimate the smoothing parameters. In this paper, such approaches for selecting the appropriate forecasting method are compared in a simulation study. They are also compared on real time series from the M3 forecasting competition. The results indicate that the information criterion approach appears to provide the best basis for an automated approach to method selection, provided that it is based on Akaike's information criterion.

Abstract: An approach to exponential smoothing that relies on a linear single source of error state space model is outlined.  A maximum likelihood method for the estimation of associated smoothing parameters is developed. Commonly used restrictions on the smoothing parameters are rationalised.  Issues surrounding model identification and selection are also considered.  It is argued that the proposed revised version of exponential smoothing provides a better framework for forecasting than either the Box-Jenkins or the traditional multi-disturbance state space approaches.

Keywords: IV estimator, concentration parameter, small concentration asymptotics, hypothesis testing, confidence region construction, valid inference.
Abstract: Poskitt and Skeels (2003) provide a new approximation to the sampling distribution of the IV estimator in a simultaneous equations model, the approximation is appropriate when the concentration parameter associated with the reduced form model is small. A basic purpose of this paper is to provide the practitioner with easily implemented inferential tools based upon extensions to these small concentration asymptotic results. We present various approximations to the sampling distribution of functions of the IV estimator based upon small concentration asymptotics, and investigate hypothesis testing procedures and confidence region construction using these approximations. It is shown that the test statistics advanced are asymptotically pivotal and that the associated critical regions generate locally uniformly most powerful invariant tests. The confidence regions are also shown to be valid. The small-concentration asymptotic approximations lead to a non-standard application of standard distributions, facilitating numerical implementation using commonly available software.

Abstract: Accurate estimates of future age-specific incidence and mortality are critical for allocation of resources to breast cancer control programs and evaluation of screening programs. The purpose of this study is to apply functional data analysis techniques to model age-specific breast cancer mortality time trends, and forecast entire age-specific mortality function using a state-space approach.  We use yearly unadjusted breast cancer mortality rates in Australia, from 1921 to 2001 in 5 year age groups (45 to 85+). We use functional data analysis techniques where mortality and incidence are modeled as curves with age as a functional covariate varying by time. Data is smoothed using nonparametric smoothing methods then decomposed (using principal components analysis) to estimate basis functions that represent the functional curve. Period effects from the fitted functions are forecast then multiplied by the basis functions, resulting in a forecast mortality curve with prediction intervals. To forecast, we adopt a state-space approach and an extension of the Pegels modeling framework for selecting among exponential smoothing methods.  Overall, breast cancer mortality rates in Australia remained relatively stable from 1960 to the late 1990's but declined over the last few years. A set of K=4 basis functions minimized the mean integrated squared forecasting error (MISFE) and accounts for 99.3% of variation around the mean mortality curve. 20 year forecast suggest a continual decline at a slower rate and stabilize beyond 2010 and by age, forecasts show a decline in all age groups with the greatest decline in older women.  We illustrate the utility of a new modelling and forecasting approach to model breast cancer mortality rates using a functional model of age. The methods have the potential to incorporate important covariates such as Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) and interventions to represent mammographic screening. This would be particularly useful for evaluating the impact of screening on mortality and incidence from breast cancer.

Keywords: Fertility Forecasting, Functional Data, Mortality Forecasting, Nonparametric Smoothing, Principal Components, Robustness.
Abstract: We propose a new method for forecasting age-specific mortality and fertility rates observed over time.  Our approach allows for smooth functions of age, is robust for outlying years due to wars and epidemics, and provides a modelling framework that is easily adapted to allow for constraints and other information.  We combine ideas from functional data analysis, nonparametric smoothing and robust statistics to form a methodology that is widely applicable to any functional time series data, and age-specific mortality and fertility in particular.  We show that our model is a generalization of the Lee-Carter model commonly used in mortality and fertility forecasting.  The methodology is applied to French mortality data and Australian fertility data, and we show that the forecasts obtained are superior to those from the Lee-Carter method and several of its variants.

Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of aggregation and non-linearity in relation to television rating forecasts. Several linear models for aggregated and disaggregated television viewing have appeared in the literature. The current analysis extends this work using an empirical approach. We compare the accuracy of population rating models, segment rating models and individual viewing behaviour models. Linear and non-linear models are fitted using regression, decision trees and neural networks, with a two-stage procedure being used to model network choice and viewing time for the individual viewing behaviour model. The most accurate forecast results are obtained from the non-linear segment rating models.
