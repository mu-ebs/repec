Abstract: In this paper, we propose a variable selection procedure based on the shrinkage estimation technique for a categorical varying-coefficient model. We apply the method to identify the relevant determinants for body mass index (BMI) from a large amount of potential factors proposed in the multidisciplinary literature, using data from the 2013 National Health Interview Survey in the United States. We quantify the varying impacts of the relevant determinants of BMI across demographic groups.

Keywords: Method of moments, unobserved heterogeneity, break-point detection, fixed T asymptotics
Abstract: This paper develops a method for testing for the presence of a single structural
break in panel data models with unobserved heterogeneity represented by a factor
error structure. The common factor approach is an appealing way to capture
the effect of unobserved variables, such as skills and innate ability in studies of
returns to education, common shocks and cross-sectional dependence in models
of economic growth, law enforcement acts and public attitudes towards crime in
statistical modelling of criminal behaviour. Ignoring these variables may result in
inconsistent parameter estimates and invalid inferences. We focus on the case where
the time frequency of the data may be yearly and thereby the number of time series
observations is small, even if the sample covers a rather long period of time. We
develop a Distance type statistic based on a Method of Moments estimator that
allows for unobserved common factors. Existing structural break tests proposed in
the literature are not valid under these circumstances. The asymptotic properties
of the test statistic are established for both known and unknown breakpoints. In
our simulation study, the method performed well, both in terms of size and power,
as well as in terms of successfully locating the time at which the break occurred.
The method is illustrated using data from a large sample of banking institutions,
providing empirical evidence on the well-known Gibrat's `Law'.

Keywords: Bayesian consistency, likelihood-free methods, conditioning, auxiliary modelbased ABC, ordinary differential equations, Lotka-Volterra model.
Abstract: Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods have become increasingly prevalent
of late, facilitating as they do the analysis of intractable, or challenging, statistical
problems. With the initial focus being primarily on the practical import of ABC, exploration
of its formal statistical properties has begun to attract more attention. The aim
of this paper is to establish general conditions under which ABC methods are Bayesian
consistent, in the sense of producing draws that yield a degenerate posterior distribution
at the true parameter (vector) asymptotically (in the sample size). We derive conditions
under which arbitrary summary statistics yield consistent inference in the Bayesian sense,
with these conditions linked to identiÖcation of the true parameters. Using simple illustrative
examples that have featured in the literature, we demonstrate that identiÖcation, and
hence consistency, is unlikely to be achieved in many cases, and propose a simple diagnostic
procedure that can indicate the presence of this problem. We also formally explore the
link between consistency and the use of auxiliary models within ABC, and illustrate the
subsequent results in the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model.

Keywords: Characteristic function, cross–sectional independence, empirical spectral distribution, linear panel data models, Marcenko-Pastur Law
Abstract: This paper proposes a new statistic to conduct cross-sectional independence test for the residuals
involved in a parametric panel data model. The proposed test statistic, which is called linear
spectral statistic (LSS), is established based on the characteristic function of the empirical spectral
distribution (ESD) of the sample correlation matrix of the residuals. The main advantage of the
proposed test statistic is that it can capture nonlinear cross-sectional dependence. Asymptotic
theory for a general class of linear spectral statistics is established, as the cross-sectional dimension
N and time length T go to infinity proportionally. This type of statistics covers many classical
statistics, including the bias-corrected Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test statistic and the likelihood
ratio test statistic. Furthermore, the power under a local alternative hypothesis is analyzed and
the asymptotic distribution of the proposed statistic under this local hypothesis is also established.
Finite sample performance shows that the proposed test statistic works well numerically in each
individual case and it can also distinguish some dependent but uncorrelated structures, for example,
nonlinear MA(1) models and multiple ARCH(1) models.

Keywords: Hierarchical forecasting, temporal aggregation, reconciliation, forecast combination
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of Temporal Hierarchies for time series forecasting. A temporal
hierarchy can be constructed for any time series by means of non-overlapping temporal
aggregation. Predictions constructed at all aggregation levels are combined with the proposed
framework to result in temporally reconciled, accurate and robust forecasts. The implied combination
mitigates modelling uncertainty, while the reconciled nature of the forecasts results in
a unified prediction that supports aligned decisions at different planning horizons: from shortterm
operational up to long-term strategic planning. The proposed methodology is independent
of forecasting models. It can embed high level managerial forecasts that incorporate complex
and unstructured information with lower level statistical forecasts. Our results show that forecasting
with temporal hierarchies increases accuracy over conventional forecasting, particularly
under increased modelling uncertainty. We discuss organisational implications of the temporally
reconciled forecasts using a case study of Accident & Emergency departments.

Abstract: Large collections of time series often have aggregation constraints due to product or geographical hierarchies. The forecasts for the disaggregated series are usually required to add up exactly to the forecasts of the aggregated series, a constraint known as “aggregate consistency”. The combination forecasts proposed by Hyndman et al. (2011) are based on a Generalized Least Squares (GLS) estimator and require an estimate of the covariance matrix of the reconciliation errors (i.e., the errors that arise due to aggregate inconsistency). We show that this is impossible to estimate in practice due to identifiability conditions.

Abstract: We propose new generic methods for decomposing seasonal data: STR (a Seasonal-Trend decomposition procedure based on Regression) and Robust STR. In some ways, STR is similar to Ridge Regression and Robust STR can be related to LASSO. Our new methods are much more general than any alternative time series decomposition methods. They allow for multiple seasonal and cyclic components, and multiple linear regressors with constant, flexible, seasonal and cyclic influence. Seasonal patterns (for both seasonal components and seasonal regressors) can be fractional and flexible over time; moreover they can be either strictly periodic or have a more complex topology. We also provide confidence intervals for the estimated components, and discuss how STR can be used for forecasting.

Keywords: Additive models, boosting, density forecasting, energy forecasting, probabilistic forecasting
Abstract: A large body of the forecasting literature so far has been focused on forecasting the conditional mean of future observations. However, there is an increasing need for generating the entire conditional distribution of future observations in order to effectively quantify the uncertainty in time series data. We present two different methods for probabilistic time series forecasting that allow the inclusion of a possibly large set of exogenous variables. One method is based on forecasting both the conditional mean and variance of the future distribution using a traditional regression approach. The other directly computes multiple quantiles of the future distribution using quantile regression. We propose an implementation for the two methods based on boosted additive models, which enjoy many useful properties including accuracy, flexibility, interpretability and automatic variable selection. We conduct extensive experiments using electricity smart meter data, on both aggregated and disaggregated scales, to compare the two forecasting methods for the challenging problem of forecasting the distribution of future electricity consumption. The empirical results demonstrate that the mean and variance forecasting provides better forecasts for aggregated demand, while the flexibility of the quantile regression approach is more suitable for disaggregated demand. These results are particularly useful since more energy data will become available at the disaggregated level in the future.

Keywords: Exponential smoothing; Proportions; Prediction intervals; Automobile sales; Market shares.
Abstract: A method is proposed for forecasting composite time series such as the market shares for multiple brands. Its novel feature is that it relies on multi-series adaptations of exponential smoothing combined with the log-ratio transformation for the conversion of proportions onto the real line. It is designed to produce forecasts that are both non-negative and sum to one; are invariant to the choice of the base series in the log-ratio transformation; recognized and exploit features such as serial dependence and non-stationary movements in the data; allow for the possibility of non-uniform interactions between the series; and contend with series that start late, finish early, or which have values close to zero. Relying on an appropriate multivariate innovations state space mode, it can be used to generate prediction distributions in addition to point forecasts and to compute the probabilities of market share increases together with prediction intervals. A shared structure between the series in the multivariate model is used to ensure that the usual proliferation of parameter is avoided. The forecasting method is illustrated using data on the annual market shares of the major (groups of) brands in the U.S. automobile market, over the period 1961-2013.

Keywords: cross-validation, time series, auto regression.
Abstract: One of the most widely used standard procedures for model evaluation in classification and regression is K-fold cross-validation (CV). However, when it comes to time series forecasting, because of the inherent serial correlation and potential non-stationarity of the data, its application is not straightforward and often omitted by practitioners in favor of an out-of-sample (OOS) evaluation. In this paper, we show that the particular setup in which time series forecasting is usually performed using Machine Learning methods renders the use of standard K-fold CV possible. We present theoretical insights supporting our arguments. Furthermore, we present a simulation study where we show empirically that K-fold CV performs favourably compared to both OOS evaluation and other time-series-specific techniques such as non-dependent cross-validation.

Keywords: Categorial variable; estimation theory; nonlinear panel data model; returns to scale.
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a panel data semiparametric varying-coefficient model in which covariates (variables affecting the coefficients) are purely categorical. This model has two features: first, fixed effects are included to allow for correlation between individual unobserved heterogeneity and the regressors; second, it allows for cross-sectional dependence through a general spatial error dependence structure. We derive a semiparametric estimator for our model by using a modified within transformation, and then show the asymptotic and finite properties for this estimator. Finally, we illustrate our model by analysing the effects of state-level banking regulations on the returns to scale of commercial banks in the U.S. Our empirical results suggest that returns to scale is higher in more regulated states than in less regulated states.

Keywords: Panel data, factor structure, endogeneity, instrumental variables
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to study the effects of common shocks on panel data models with endogenous explanatory variables when the cross section dimension (N) is large and the time series dimension (T) is fixed: this relies on conditional strong laws of large numbers and conditional central limit theorems. These results can act as a useful reference for readers who wish to further investigate the effects of common shocks on panel data. The paper shows that the key assumption in determining consistency of the panel TSLS and LIML estimators is the independence of the factor loadings in the reduced form errors from the factor loadings in the exogenous variables and instruments conditional on the factors. We also show that these estimators have non-standard asymptotic distributions but tests on the coefficients have standard distributions under the null hypothesis provided the estimators are consistent.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a partially linear panel data model with cross-sectional dependence and non-stationarity. Meanwhile, we allow fixed effects to be correlated with the regressors to capture unobservable heterogeneity. Under a general spatial error dependence structure, we then established some consistent closed-form estimates for both the unknown parameters and the unknown function for the case where N and T go jointly to infinity. Rates of convergence and asymptotic normality results are established for the proposed estimators. Both the finite-sample performance and the empirical applications show that the proposed estimation method works well when the cross-sectional dependence exists in the data set.

Keywords: De-convolution kernel estimator, regression discontinuity, error-in-variables, demand for private health insurance.
Abstract: This paper is motivated by our attempt to answer an empirical question: how is private health insurance take-up in Australia affected by the income threshold at which the Medicare Levy Surcharge (MLS) kicks in? We propose a new difference de-convolution kernel estimator for the location and size of regression discontinuities. We also propose a bootstrapping procedure for estimating confidence bands for the estimated discontinuity. Performance of the estimator is evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations before it is applied to estimating the effect of the income threshold of Medicare Levy Surcharge on the take-up of private health insurance in Australia using contaminated data.

Keywords: Local to unity asymptotics, Neyman-Pearson lemma, nuisance parameters, power envelope, unit root testing.
Abstract: In the absence of uniformly most powerful (UMP) tests or uniformly most powerful invariant (UMPI) TESTS, King (1987c) suggested the use of Point Optimal (PO) tests, which are most powerful at a chosen point under the alternative hypothesis. This paper surveys the literature and major developments on point optimal testing since 1987 and suggests some areas for future research. Topics include tests for which all nuisance parameters have been eliminated and dealing with nuisance parameters via (i) a weighted average of p values, (ii) approximate point optimal tests, (iii) plugging in estimated parameter values, (iv) using asymptotics and (v) integration. Progress on using point-optimal testing principles for two-sided testing and multi-dimensional alternatives is also reviewed. The paper concludes with thoughts on how best to deal with nuisance parameters under both the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the development of a new class of point optimal test for multi-dimensional testing.

Keywords: Exchange rate fundamentals, government consumption, monetary policy, panel vector error correction model, productivity improvement in the traded sector, real exchange rates, sign and zero restrictions, trade liberalization.
Abstract: This paper examines real exchange rate responses to shocks in exchange rate determinants for fourteen Asian developing countries. The analysis is based on a panel structural vector error correction model, and the shocks are identified using sign and zero restrictions. We find that trade liberalization generates permanent depreciation, and higher government consumption causes persistent appreciation. Traded-sector productivity gains induce appreciation but their effects are not immediate and last only for a few years. Real exchange rate responses to unexpected monetary tightening are consistent with the long-run neutrality of money. The evidence suggests that trade liberalization and government consumption have a strong effect on real exchange rates, while the effects of traded-sector productivity shocks are much weaker.

Keywords: Local constant estimator, bandwidth, Markov chain Monte Carlo
Abstract: Bandwidth plays an important role in determining the performance of nonparametric estimators, such as the local constant estimator. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to bandwidth estimation for local constant estimators of time-varying coefficients in time series models. We establish a large sample theory for the proposed bandwidth estimator and Bayesian estimators of the unknown parameters involved in the error density. A Monte Carlo simulation study shows that (i) the proposed Bayesian estimators for bandwidths and parameters in the error density have satisfactory finite sample performance; and (ii) our proposed Bayesian approach achieves better performance in estimating the bandwidths than the normal reference rule and cross-validation. Moreover, we apply our proposed Bayesian bandwidth estimation method for the time-varying coefficient models that explain Okun's law and the relationship between consumption growth and income growth in the US. For each model, we also provide calibrated parametric forms of the time-varying coefficients.

Keywords: State space model, Single source of error, Time varying parameter, Time series, Forecast accuracy
Abstract: In There is evidence that exponential smoothing methods as well as time varying parameter models perform relatively well in forecasting comparisons. The aim of this paper is to introduce a new forecasting technique by integrating the exponential smoothing model with regressors whose coefficients are time varying. In doing this, we construct an exponential smoothing model with regressors by extending Holt's linear exponential smoothing model. We then translate it into an equivalent state space structure so that the parameters can be estimated via the maximum likely-hood estimation procedure. Due to the potential problem in the updating equation for the regressor coefficients when the change in regressor is too small, we propose an alternative structure of the state space model which allows the updating process to be put on hold until sufficient information is available. An empirical study of forecast accuracy shows that the new model performs better than the existing exponential smoothing model as well as the linear regression model.

Keywords: β-null recurrent, cointegration, Markov chain, threshold VAR models
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new class of bivariate threshold VAR cointegration models. In the models, outside a compact region, the processes are cointegrated, while in the compact region, we allow different kinds of possibilities. We show that the bivariate processes from a 1/2-null recurrent system. We also find that the convergence rate for the estimators for the coefficients in the outside regime is
T^(1/2), while the convergence rate for the estimators for the coefficients in the middle regime is T^(1/4). Also, we show that the convergence rate of the cointegrating coefficient is <i>T</i>, which is same as linear cointegration model. The Monte Carlo simulation results suggest that the estimators perform reasonably well in finite samples. Applying the proposed model to study the dynamic relationship between Federal funds rate and 3-month Treasury bill rate, we find that cointegrating coefficients are the same for the two regimes while the short run loading coefficients are different.
