Keywords: Exponential smoothing, Fourier series, prediction intervals, seasonality, state space models, time series decomposition
Abstract: A new innovations state space modeling framework, incorporating Box-Cox transformations, Fourier series with time varying coefficients and ARMA error correction, is introduced for forecasting complex seasonal time series that cannot be handled using existing forecasting models. Such complex time series include time series with multiple seasonal periods, high frequency seasonality, non-integer seasonality and dual-calendar effects. Our new modelling framework provides an alternative to existing exponential smoothing models, and is shown to have many advantages. The methods for initialization and estimation, including likelihood evaluation, are presented, and analytical expressions for point forecasts and interval predictions under the assumption of Gaussian errors are derived, leading to a simple, comprehensible approach to forecasting complex seasonal time series. Our trigonometric formulation is also presented as a means of decomposing complex seasonal time series, which cannot be decomposed using any of the existing decomposition methods. The approach is useful in a broad range of applications, and we illustrate its versatility in three empirical studies where it demonstrates excellent forecasting performance over a range of prediction horizons. In addition, we show that our trigonometric decomposition leads to the identification and extraction of seasonal components, which are otherwise not apparent in the time series plot itself.

Keywords: Idiosyncratic volatility, expected return, analytical derivation, cross-sectional analysis
Abstract: Modelling stock return generating process as a single factor model, we show analytically that the relation between idiosyncratic volatility measured as variance of the residuals and expected stock return in the cross-section may be represented by a parabola that opens to the left and has horizontal axis. This relation is uncovered for stocks of similar volatility and no abnormal return. The sensitivity of the derived relation when these restrictions are relaxed is discussed. Our findings, to a great extent, help uncover the shape of the non-linear inverse relation between idiosyncratic volatility and expected stock return observed in the cross-section in previous empirical studies.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the use of description length principles to select an appropriate number of basis functions for functional data. We provide a flexible definition of the dimension of a random function that is constructed directly from the Karhunen-Loève expansion of the observed process. Our results show that although the classical, principle component variance decomposition technique will behave in a coherent manner, in general, the dimension chosen by this technique will not be consistent. We describe two description length criteria, and prove that they are consistent and that in low noise settings they will identify the true finite dimension of a signal that is embedded in noise. Two examples, one from mass-spectroscopy and the one from climatology, are used to illustrate our ideas. We also explore the application of different forms of the bootstrap for functional data and use these to demonstrate the workings of our theoretical results.

Abstract: This paper develops a new methodology for identifying the structure of VARMA time series models. The analysis proceeds by examining the echelon canonical form and presents a fully automatic data driven approach to model specification using a new technique to determine the Kronecker invariants. A novel feature of the inferential procedures developed here is that they work in terms of a canonical scalar ARMAX representation in which the exogenous regressors are given by predetermined contemporaneous and lagged values of other variables in the VARMA system. This feature facilitates the construction of algorithms which, from the perspective of macroeconomic modeling, are efficacious in that they do not use AR approximations at any stage. Algorithms that are applicable to both asymptotically stationary and unit-root, partially nonstationary (cointegrated) time series models are presented. A sequence of lemmas and theorems show that the algorithms are based on calculations that yield strongly consistent estimates.

Abstract: In this paper we propose a new set of multivariate stochastic models that capture time varying seasonality within the vector innovations structural time series (VISTS) framework. These models encapsulate exponential smoothing methods in a multivariate setting. The models considered are the local level, local trend and damped trend VISTS models with an additive multivariate seasonal component. We evaluate their performances for forecasting international tourist arrivals from eleven source countries to Australia and New Zealand.

Keywords: Tourism demand, Dynamic panel models, Travel flow model.
Abstract: In this paper Australian domestic and international inbound travel are modelled by an anisotropic dynamic spatial lag panel Origin-Destination (OD) travel flow model. Spatial OD travel flow models have traditionally been applied in a single cross-sectional context, where the spatial structure is assumed to have reached its long run equilibrium and temporal dynamics are not explicitly considered. On the other hand, spatial effects are rarely accounted for in traditional tourism demand modelling. We attempt to address this dichotomy between spatial modelling and time series modelling in tourism research by using a spatial-temporal model. In particular, tourism behaviour is modelled as travel flows between regions. Temporal dependencies are accounted for via the inclusion of autoregressive components, while spatial autocorrelations are explicitly accounted for at both the origin and the destination. We allow the strength of spatial autocorrelation to exhibit seasonal variations, and we allow for the possibility of asymmetry between capital-city neighbours and non-capital-city neighbours. Significant spatial dynamics have been uncovered, which lead to some interesting policy implications.

Keywords: Exponential smoothing; Intraday data; Electricity load; Call centre arrivals.
Abstract: This paper concerns the forecasting of seasonal intraday time series. An extension of Holt-Winters exponential smoothing has been proposed that smoothes an intraday cycle and an intraweek cycle. A recently proposed exponential smoothing method involves smoothing a different intraday cycle for each distinct type of day of the week. Similar days are allocated identical intraday cycles. A limitation is that the method allows only whole days to be treated as identical. We introduce an exponential smoothing formulation that allows parts of different days of the week to be treated as identical. The result is a method that involves the smoothing and initialisation of fewer terms than the other two exponential smoothing methods. We evaluate forecasting up to a day ahead using two empirical studies. For electricity load data, the new method compares well with a range of alternatives. The second study involves a series of arrivals at a call centre that is open for a shorter duration at the weekends than on weekdays. By contrast with the previously proposed exponential smoothing methods, our new method can model in a straightforward way this situation, where the number of periods on each day of the week is not the same.

Abstract: We present a nonparametric method to forecast a seasonal univariate time series, and propose four dynamic updating methods to improve point forecast accuracy. Our methods consider a seasonal univariate time series as a functional time series. We propose first to reduce the dimensionality by applying functional principal component analysis to the historical observations, and then to use univariate time series forecasting and functional principal component regression techniques. When data in the most recent year are partially observed, we improve point forecast accuracy using dynamic updating methods. We also introduce a nonparametric approach to construct prediction intervals of updated forecasts, and compare the empirical coverage probability with an existing parametric method. Our approaches are data-driven and computationally fast, and hence they are feasible to be applied in real time high frequency dynamic updating. The methods are demonstrated using monthly sea surface temperatures from 1950 to 2008.

Keywords: Nonparametric Inference; Asymptotic Efficiency; Count Time Series; INAR Model Class; Bootstrap Distributions; Iceberg Stock Market Orders.
Abstract: Optimal probabilistic forecasts of integer-valued random variables are derived. The optimality is achieved by estimating the forecast distribution nonparametrically over a given broad model class and proving asymptotic efficiency in that setting. The ideas are demonstrated within the context of the integer autoregressive class of models, which is a suitable class for any count data that can be interpreted as a queue, stock, birth and death process or branching process. The theoretical proofs of asymptotic optimality are supplemented by simulation results which demonstrate the overall superiority of the nonparametric method relative to a misspecified parametric maximum likelihood estimator, in large but .nite samples. The method is applied to counts of wage claim benefits, stock market iceberg orders and civilian deaths in Iraq, with bootstrap methods used to quantify sampling variation in the estimated forecast distributions.

Abstract: This paper establishes vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) models for Malaysian monetary policy analysis by efficiently identifying and simultaneously estimating the model parameters using full information maximum likelihood. The monetary literature is largely dominated by vector autoregressive (VAR) and structural vector autoregressive (SVAR).models, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to use VARMA modelling to investigate monetary policy. Malaysia is an interesting small open economy to study because of the capital control measures imposed by the government following the 1997 Asian financial crisis. A comparison of the impulse responses generated by these three models for the pre- and post-crisis periods indicates that the VARMA model impulse responses are consistent with prior expectations based on economic theories and policies pursued by the Malaysian government, particularly in the post-crisis period. Furthermore, uncovering the way in which various intermediate channels work would help Bank Negara Malaysia to steer the economy in the right direction so that monetary policy can still remain an effective policy measure in achieving sustainable economic growth and price stability.

Keywords: Productivity decomposition; Translog output distance function.
Abstract: This paper provides parametric estimates of technical change, efficiency change, economies of scale, and total factor productivity growth for large banks (those with assets in excess of $1 billion) in the United States, over the period from 2000 to 2005. This is done by estimating an output distance function subject to theoretical regularity within a Bayesian framework. We find that failure to incorporate theoretical regularity conditions results in mismeasured shadow revenue and/or cost shares, which in turn leads to perverse conclusions regarding productivity growth. Our results from the regularity-constrained model show that total factor productivity of the large U.S. banks grew at an average rate of 1.98% over the sample period. However, our estimates also show a clear downward trend in the growth rate of total factor productivity and our decomposition of the primal Divisia total factor productivity growth index into its three components - technical change, efficiency change, and economies of scale - indicates that technical change is the driving force behind this decline.

Abstract: Using an innovations state space approach, it has been found that the Akaike information criterion (AIC) works slightly better, on average, than prediction validation on withheld data, for choosing between the various common methods of exponential smoothing for forecasting. There is, however, a puzzle. Should the count of the seed states be incorporated into the penalty term in the AIC formula? We examine arguments for and against this practice in an attempt to find an acceptable resolution of this question.

Keywords: Cost Function; Input demands; Share equations; Translog; Normalized Quadratic; Error specification.
Abstract: In the case of input demand systems based on specification of technology by a Translog cost function, it is common to estimate either a system of share equations alone, or to supplement them by the cost function. By adding up, one of the share equations is excluded. In this paper it is argued that a system of n-1 share equations is essentially incomplete, whereas if the n-1 share equations are supplemented by the cost function the implied error structure is inadmissible. Similarly, if the technology is specified by a normalized quadratic cost function, it is common to estimate either a system of n-1 demand equations alone, or to supplement them by the cost function. In both cases, the implied error structure is again inadmissible.

Abstract: We study the joint determination of the lag length, the dimension of the 
cointegrating space and the rank of the matrix of short-run parameters of a vector 
autoregressive (VAR) model using model selection criteria. We consider model 
selection criteria which have data-dependent penalties for a lack of parsimony, as 
well as the traditional ones. We suggest a new procedure which is a hybrid of 
traditional criteria with data-dependant penalties. In order to compute the fit of 
each model, we propose an iterative procedure to compute the maximum likelihood 
estimates of parameters of a VAR model with short-run and long-run restrictions. Our 
Monte Carlo simulations measure the improvements in forecasting accuracy that can 
arise from the joint determination of lag-length and rank, relative to the commonly 
used procedure of selecting the lag-length only and then testing for cointegration.

Keywords: Mean-variance preferences; expected utility; lognormal assets; risk

Abstract: In most finance papers and textbooks mean-variance preferences are usually 
introduced and motivated as a special case of expected utility theory. In general, 
the two sufficient conditions to allow this are either quadratic preferences with an 
arbitrary distribution of stochastic assets, or arbitrary preferences with Normally 
distributed assets. In the first case, the specific functional form of mean-variance 
preferences follows naturally. In the second case, the only specific functional form 
usually provided is the case of negative exponential preferences. In this note, the 
specific functional form for mean-variance preferences is derived for the much more 
realistic example of lognormally distributed assets, and constant relative risk 
aversion (CRRA) preferences.
