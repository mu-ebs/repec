abstract: A new class of models for data showing trend and multiplicative seasonality 
    is presented. The models allow the forecast error variance to depend on the 
    trend and/ or the seasonality. It can be shown that each of these models has 
    the same updating equations and forecast functions as the multiplicative 
    Holt-Winters method, regardless of whether the error variation in the model is 
    constant or not. While the point forecasts from the different models are 
    identical, the prediction intervals will, of course, depend on the structure 
    of the error variance and so it is essential to be able to choose the most 
    appropriate form of model. Two methods for making this choice are presented 
    and examined by simulation.

abstract: We consider modelling time series using a generalized additive model with 
    first- order Markov structure and mixed transition density having a discrete 
    component at zero and a continuous component with positive sample space. 
    Such models have application, for example, in modelling daily occurrence and 
    intensity of rainfall, and in modelling the number and size of insurance claims. We 
    show how these methods extend the usual sinusoidal seasonal assumption in 
    standard chain- dependent models by assuming a general smooth pattern of 
    occurrence and intensity over time. These models can be fitted using standard 
    statistical software. The methods of Grunwald and Jones (1998) can be used to 
    combine these separate occurrence and intensity models into a single model for 
    amount. We use 36 years of rainfall data from Melbourne, Australia, as a 
    vehicle of illustration, and use the models to investigate the effect of the 
    El Nino phenomenon on Melbourne's rainfall.

Keywords: Statistics, teaching, prediction, probability model, prediction interval.
length: 15 pages
abstract: Statistics is commonly taught as a set of techniques to aid in decision 
    making, by extracting information from data. It is argued here that the 
    underlying purpose, often implicit rather than explicit, of every statistical 
    analysis is to establish a set of probability models which can be used to 
    predict values of one or more variables. Such a model constitutes 'information' 
    only in the sense, and to the extent, that it provides predictions of 
    sufficient quality to be useful for decision making. The quality of the 
    decision making is determined by the quality of the predictions, and hence 
    by that of the models used. Using natural criteria, the 'best predictions' 
    for nominal and numeric variables are respectively the mode and mean. For a 
    nominal variable, the quality of a prediction is measured by the probability 
    of error; for a numeric variable, it is specified using a prediction interval. 
    Presenting statistical analysis in this way provides students with a clearer 
    understanding of what a statistical analysis is, and its role in decision 
    making.

abstract: In analysing the effects of economic policy in a Federal system, such as 
    Australia, it is important to understand the interactions between the States 
    and Territories. In particular, given that there is free movement between 
    labour markets, to analyse economic policy it is important to understand the 
    factors influencing inter- regional migration. In this paper we use data from 
    1982 to 1996 to estimate a structural econometric model of inter-regional 
    migration. The results are then used to re-specify and calibrate the Computable 
    General Equilibrium model MONASH-MRF. This then provides a more detailed 
    picture of labour market responses when we subsequently simulate the response 
    of net interstate migration to changes in State Government spending.

abstract: We compare three methods of estimating the duration, or half-life, of how 
    well each method works with the data aggregated over different time intervals. 
    In contrast with the existing theory on the, so called, data interval bias, 
    our experiments are based upon realistic advertising schedules. Our results 
    appear to indicate that the indirect "t-ratio" estimating procedure favoured 
    by practitioners works well in the presence of such temporal aggregation. 
    Additionally, we suggest a transformation that can be used in combination 
    with the indirect "t-ratio" estimating procedure to obtain estimates of the 
    underlying microperiod half- life from a variety of common (macro) data 
    frequencies.

abstract: Adaptations of simple exponential smoothing are presented that aim to unify 
    the task of forecasting demand for both slow and fast moving inventories. A 
    feature of the adaptations is that they are designed to ensure that the 
    resulting prediction distributions have only a nonnegative domain. A 
    parametric bootstrap approach is proposed for generating empirical 
    approximations for the so-called lead-time demand distribution, something 
    required for inventory control calculations. The proposed methods are 
    illustrated and their performance compared on real demand data for car parts.

abstract: Forecasting large numbers of time series is a costly and time-consuming 
    exercise. Before forecasting a large number of series that are logically 
    connected in some way, the authors can first cluster them into groups of 
    similar series. In this paper they investigate forecasting the series in each 
    cluster. Similar series are first grouped together using a clustering procedure 
    that is based on a test of hypothesis. The series in each cluster are then 
    pooled together and forecasts are obtained. Simulated results show that this 
    procedure for forecasting similar series performs reasonably well.

Length: 28 pages
Abstract: Exponential smoothing, often used for sales forecasting in inventory control, 
    has always been rationalized in terms of statistical models that possess errors 
    with constant variances. It is shown in this paper that exponential smoothing 
    remains the appropriate approach under more general conditions where the 
    variances are allowed to grow and contract with corresponding movements in the 
    underlying level. The implications for estimation and prediction are explored. 
    In particular the problem of finding the prediction distribution of aggregate 
    lead- time demand for use in inventory control calculations is considered. 
    It is found that unless a drift term is added to simple exponential smoothing, 
    the prediction distribution is largely unaffected by the variance assumption. 
    A method for establishing order-up-to levels and reorder levels directly from 
    the simulated prediction distributions is also proposed.

Abstract: We use the model developed in Sarin and Vahid (1999, GEB) to explain the 
    experiments reported in Erev and Roth (1998, AER). The model supposes that 
    players maximize subject to their "beliefs" which are non-probabilistic and 
    scalar-valued. They are intended to describe the payoffs the players 
    subjectively assess they will obtain from a strategy. In an earlier paper 
    (Sarin and Vahid (1997) we showed that the model predicted behaviour in 
    repeated coordination games remarkably well, and better than equilibrium 
    theory of reinforcement learning models. In this paper we show that the same 
    one-parameter model can also explain behaviour in games with a unique mixed 
    strategy Nash equilibrium better than alternative models. Hence, we obtain 
    further support for the simple dynamic model.

Keywords: Reduced rank regression, marginal likelihoods, Bayes factors, Bayesian analysis
Length: 25 pages
Abstract: Estimation of the reduced rank regression model requires restrictions be 
    imposed upon the model. Two forms of restrictions are commonly used. Earlier 
    Bayesian work relied on the triangular method of identification which imposes 
    an a priori ordering on the variables in the system, however, incorrect 
    ordering of the variables can result in model misspecification. Bayesian 
    estimation of the reduced rank regression model without ordering restrictions 
    was presented in Strachan (1998) and follows the classical approach of Anderson 
    (1951) and Johansen (1998). This method of estimation avoids placing 
    restrictions on the space spanned by the reduced rank relations and simplifies 
    testing of restrictions on that space. In this paper, a method for estimating 
    approximate marginal likelihoods and Bayes factors is presented for this model, 
    using Laplace approximations for integrals. These Bayes factors algebraically 
    resemble the Johansen trace statistic (1995), hence the title. We consider the 
    model with rank r and no restrictions on the reduced rank relations.

Abstract: The basic ideals underlying the Kalman filter are outlined in this paper 
    without direct recourse to the complex formulae normally associated with this 
    method. The novel feature of the paper is its reliance on a new algebraic 
    system based on the first two moments of the multivariate normal distribution. 
    The resulting framework lends itself to an object-oriented implementation on 
    computing machines and so many of the ideas are presented in these terms. The 
    paper provides yet another perspective of Kalman filtering, one that many 
    should find relatively easy to understand.
