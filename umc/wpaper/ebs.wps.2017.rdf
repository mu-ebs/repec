Abstract: Large collections of time series often have aggregation constraints due to product or geographical
groupings. The forecasts for the most disaggregated series are usually required to add-up
exactly to the forecasts of the aggregated series, a constraint we refer to as "coherence". Forecast
reconciliation is the process of adjusting forecasts to make them coherent.

The reconciliation algorithm proposed by Hyndman et al. (2011) is based on a generalized least
squares estimator that requires an estimate of the covariance matrix of the coherency errors (i.e.,
the errors that arise due to incoherence). We show that this matrix is impossible to estimate in
practice due to identifiability conditions.

We propose a new forecast reconciliation approach that incorporates the information from a
full covariance matrix of forecast errors in obtaining a set of coherent forecasts. Our approach
minimizes the mean squared error of the coherent forecasts across the entire collection of time
series under the assumption of unbiasedness. The minimization problem has a closed form
solution. We make this solution scalable by providing a computationally efficient representation.
We evaluate the performance of the proposed method compared to alternative methods using a
series of simulation designs which take into account various features of the collected time series.
This is followed by an empirical application using Australian domestic tourism data. The results
indicate that the proposed method works well with artificial and real data.

Keywords: Moment condition models, outliers, misspecification. 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new Bayesian approach for analysing moment condition models in
the situation where the data may be contaminated by outliers. The approach builds upon the
foundations developed by Schennach (2005) who proposed the Bayesian exponentially tilted empirical
likelihood (BETEL) method, justified by the fact that an empirical likelihood (EL) can
be interpreted as the nonparametric limit of a Bayesian procedure when the implied probabilities
are obtained from maximizing entropy subject to some given moment constraints. Considering
the impact that outliers are thought to have on the estimation of population moments, we
develop a new robust BETEL (RBETEL) inferential methodology to deal with this potential
problem. We show how the BETEL methods are linked to the recent work of Bissiri et al.
(2016) who propose a general framework to update prior belief via a loss function. A controlled
simulation experiment is conducted to investigate the performance of the RBETEL method. We
find that the proposed methodology produces reliable posterior inference for the fundamental
relationships that are embedded in the majority of the data, even when outliers are present.
The method is also illustrated in an empirical study relating brain weight to body weight using
a dataset containing sixty-five different land animal species.

Keywords: Gibbs sampler, hierarchical random coefficients, length of stay, hospital ranking. 
Abstract: Inequality between private and public patients in Australia has been an ongoing
concern due to its two tiered insurance system. This paper investigates the variations
in hospital length of stay for hip replacements using Victorian Admitted Episodes
Dataset from 2003/2004 to 2014/2015, employing a Bayesian hierarchical random coefficient
model with trend allowing for structural break. We find systematic differences
in the length of stay between public and private hospitals, after observable patient complexity
is controlled. This suggests shorter stay in public hospitals due to pressure from
Activity-based funding scheme, and longer stay in private system due to potential moral
hazard. Our counterfactual analysis shows that public patients stay 1.4 days shorter
than private in 2014, which leads to the 'quicker but sicker' concern that is commonly
voiced by the public. We also identify widespread variations among individual hospitals.
Sources for such variation warrant closer investigation by policy makers.

Keywords: Loss given default, credit risk, nonlinearity, kernel estimation, defaulted debt, simulation. 
Abstract: We propose a flexible and robust nonparametric local logit regression for modelling
and predicting defaulted loans' recovery rates that lie in [0,1]. Applying
the model to the widely studied Moody's recovery dataset and estimating it by
a data-driven method, the local logit regression uncovers the underlying nonlinear
relationship between the recovery and covariates, which include loan/borrower characteristics
and economic conditions. We find some significant nonlinear marginal
and interaction effects of conditioning variables on recoveries of defaulted loans.
The presence of such nonlinear economic effects enriches the local logit model specification
that supports the improved recovery prediction. This paper is the first
to study a nonparametric regression model that not only generates unbiased and
improved recovery predictions of defaulted loans relative to the parametric counterpart,
it also facilitates reliable inference on marginal and interaction effects of
loan/borrower characteristics and economic conditions. Moreover, incorporating
these nonlinear marginal and interaction effects, we improve the specification of
parametric regression for fractional response variable, which we call "calibrated"
model, the predictive performance of which is comparable to that of local logit
model. This calibrated parametric model will be attractive to applied researchers
and industry professionals working in the risk management area and unfamiliar with
nonparametric machinery.

power for stock returns while the book-to-market ratio and earning-price ratio have
little predictive power.

are studied using the generalized method of moments (GMM) and sieve method
dealing with the nonparametric parameter. The consistency and normality for the
GMM estimators are established. Meanwhile, a new test statistic is proposed for overidentification
issue. Numerical examples are used to verify the established theory.

Keywords: Health care expenditure, nonlinear trending function, nonstationary time series. 
Abstract: This paper considers a semiparametric panel data model with heterogeneous coefficients
and individual-specific trending functions, where the random errors are assumed to be
serially correlated and cross-sectionally dependent. We propose mean group estimators for
the coefficients and trending functions involved in the model. It can be shown that the
proposed estimators can achieve an asymptotic consistency with rates of root-NT and
root-NTh, respectively as (N, T) -> (&#8734, &#8734), where N is allowed to increase faster than
T. Furthermore, a statistic for testing homogeneous coefficients is constructed based on
the difference between the mean group estimator and a pooled estimator. Its asymptotic
distributions are established under both the null and a sequence of local alternatives, even
if the difference between these estimators vanishes considerably fast (can achieve root-NT2
rate at most under the null) and consistent estimator available for the covariance matrix is
not required explicitly. The finite sample performance of the proposed estimators together
with the size and local power properties of the test are demonstrated by simulated data
examples, and an empirical application with the OECD health care expenditure dataset is
also provided.

Abstract: We introduce a Bayesian approach for assessing Lorenz and stochastic dominance. For two
income distributions, say X and Y, estimated via Markov chain Monte Carlo, we describe how to
compute posterior probabilities for (i) X dominates Y, (ii) Y dominates X, and (iii) neither Y nor
X is dominant. The proposed approach is applied to Indonesian income distributions using
mixtures of gamma densities that ensure flexible modelling. Probability curves depicting the
probability of dominance at each population proportion are used to explain changes in dominance
probabilities over restricted ranges relevant for poverty orderings. They also explain some
seemingly contradictory outcomes from the p-values of some sampling theory tests.

Abstract: This paper provides an extensive evaluation of high frequency jump tests and measures, in
the context of dynamic models for asset price jumps. Specifically, we investigate: i) the power of
alternative tests to detect individual price jumps, including in the presence of volatility jumps; ii)
the frequency with which sequences of dynamic jumps are identified; iii) the accuracy with which
the magnitude and sign of sequential jumps are estimated; and iv) the robustness of inference
about dynamic jumps to test and measure design. Substantial differences are discerned in the
performance of alternative methods in certain dimensions, with inference being sensitive to these
differences in some cases. Accounting for measurement error when using measures constructed
from high frequency data to conduct inference on dynamic jump models would appear to be
advisable.

Keywords: Kernel estimator, locally stationary process, series estimator, stock return prediction. 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose three new predictive models: the multi-step nonparametric
predictive regression model and the multi-step additive predictive regression model, in which
the predictive variables are locally stationary time series; and the multi-step time-varying
coefficient predictive regression model, in which the predictive variables are stochastically
nonstationary. We also establish the estimation theory and asymptotic properties for these
models in the short horizon and long horizon case. To evaluate the effectiveness of these
models, we investigate their capability of stock return prediction. The empirical results
show that all of these models can substantially outperform the traditional linear predictive
regression model in terms of both in-sample and out-of-sample performance. In addition,
we find that these models can always beat the historical mean model in terms of in-sample
fitting, and also for some cases in terms of the out-of-sample forecasting.

Abstract: Approximate Bayesian computation is becoming an accepted tool for statistical analysis in models with 
intractable likelihoods. With the initial focus being primarily on the practical import of this algorithm, exploration of its 
formal statistical properties has begun to attract more attention. In this paper we consider the asymptotic behaviour of the 
posterior distribution obtained by this method. We give general results on: (i) the rate at which the posterior concentrates 
on sets containing the true parameter (vector); (ii) the limiting shape of the posterior; and (iii) the asymptotic distribution 
of the ensuing posterior mean. These results hold under given rates for the tolerance used within the method, mild regularity
conditions on the summary statistics, and a condition linked to identification of the true parameters. Important implications of 
the theoretical results for practitioners are discussed.

Keywords: cointegration, FM-kernel estimation, generalized Wald test, global rotation, kernel degeneracy, local rotation, super-consistency, time-varying coecients.
Abstract: This paper studies nonlinear cointegrating models with time-varying coecients and multiple nonstationary
regressors using classic kernel smoothing methods to estimate the coecient functions. Extending
earlier work on nonstationary kernel regression to take account of practical features of the data, we allow the
regressors to be cointegrated and to embody a mixture of stochastic and deterministic trends, complications
which result in asymptotic degeneracy of the kernel-weighted signal matrix. To address these complications
new local and global rotation techniques are introduced to transform the covariate space to accommodate
multiple scenarios of induced degeneracy. Under certain regularity conditions we derive asymptotic results that differ 
substantially from existing kernel regression asymptotics, leading to new limit theory under
multiple convergence rates. For the practically important case of endogenous nonstationary regressors we
propose a fully-modified kernel estimator whose limit distribution theory corresponds to the prototypical pure
(i.e., exogenous covariate) cointegration case, thereby facilitating inference using a generalized Wald-type
test statistic. These results substantially generalize econometric estimation and testing techniques in the
cointegration literature to accommodate time variation and complications of co-moving regressors. Finally
an empirical illustration to aggregate US data on consumption, income, and interest rates is provided.

Abstract: This paper studies a model with both a parametric global trend and a nonparametric
local trend. This model may be of interest in a number of applications in economics, finance,
ecology, and geology. The model nests the parametric global trend model considered in
Phillips (2007) and Robinson (2012), and the nonparametric local trend model. We first
propose two hypothesis tests to detect whether either of the special cases are appropriate.
For the case where both null hypotheses are rejected, we propose an estimation method
to capture both aspects of the time trend. We establish consistency and some distribution
theory in the presence of a large sample. Moreover, we examine the proposed hypothesis
tests and estimation methods through both simulated and real data examples. Finally, we
discuss some potential extensions and issues when modelling time effects.

Keywords: probabilistic forecasts, asymptotically uniformly most accurate confidence regions,
time series models, animated graphics, realized volatility, heterogeneous autoregressive model. 
Abstract: The focus of this paper is on the quantification of sampling variation in frequentist probabilistic
forecasts. We propose a method of constructing confidence sets that respects the
functional nature of the forecast distribution, and use animated graphics to visualize the
impact of parameter uncertainty on the location, dispersion and shape of the distribution.
The confidence sets are derived via the inversion of a Wald test and are asymptotically
uniformly most accurate and, hence, optimal in this sense. A wide range of linear and
non-linear time series models - encompassing long memory, state space and mixture specifications
- is used to demonstrate the procedure, based on artificially generated data.
An empirical example in which distributional forecasts of both financial returns and its
stochastic volatility are produced is then used to illustrate the practical importance of
accommodating sampling variation in the manner proposed.

Keywords: de-convolution kernel estimator, regression discontinuity, error-in-variables, demand for private health insurance.
Abstract: This paper is motivated by our attempt to answer an empirical question: how is private health insurance take-up in 
Australia affected by the income threshold at which the Medicare Levy Surcharge (MLS) kicks in? We propose a new difference 
de-convolution kernel estimator for the location and size of regression discontinuities. We also propose a bootstrapping
procedure for estimating confidence bands for the estimated discontinuity. Performance of the estimator is evaluated by 
Monte Carlo simulations before it is applied to estimating the effect of the income threshold of Medicare Levy Surcharge 
on the take-up of private health insurance in Australia using contaminated data.

Keywords: model averaging, reversible jump MCMC, vine copulas, dimension reduction, multidimensional poverty index.
Abstract: We develop efficient Bayesian inference for the 1-factor copula model with two significant contributions over classical inference. 
First, our approach leads to straightforward inference on the latent factor since iterates of the latent factor are generated as a by-product
in the proposed Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. In contrast, there is no known classical approach for inference on the latents. Second, 
by developing a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme, we are able to select or average over factor copula specifications that 
are constructed from a large set of candidate parametric bivariate copula building blocks. Our approach can accommodate margins that are 
discrete, continuous or a combination of both. Through extensive simulations multiple schemes are compared on the basis of computational 
and Monte Carlo efficiency. The preferred schemes provide reliable inference on all parameters including the latent factor and model space. 
The potential of the proposed methodology is highlighted in an empirical study of ten binary variables measuring the multidimensional nature 
of poverty collected for 11463 East Timorese households. We construct a poverty index using estimates of the latent factor. Compared to a 
classical analysis, our method yields better out-of-sample fit and uncovers a variety of flexible relationships between the latent measure 
and observed variables by averaging over a diverse set of copulas.

Keywords: Bayesian average, conditional mean estimation, ergodic theorem, summary statistic.
Abstract: Bai (2009) proposes a recursive least-squares estimation method for large panel data models
with unobservable interactive fixed effects, but the impact of recursion on the asymptotic properties
of the least-squares estimators is not taken into account. In this paper, we extend Bai (2009)
by investigating the recursive estimator asymptotically. In general, the asymptotic properties we
establish for the recursive estimators largely complement the theory and practice of the recursive
least-squares procedure suggested by Bai (2009). In particular, we show that consistency of
the recursive estimator depends on three key points, consistency of the initial OLS estimator, the
number of recursive steps and the endogeneity arising due to the dependence between regressors
and interactive effects. Compared to the theoretical estimator in Bai (2009), such endogeneity
affects the convergence rate of recursive least-squares estimators. Finite sample properties of the
proposed estimators are investigated using a simulation study.

Keywords: Bayesian average, conditional mean estimation, ergodic theorem, summary statistic.
Abstract: Ergodic theorem shows that ergodic averages of the posterior draws converge in probability to the posterior mean under the stationarity assumption. The literature 
also shows that the posterior distribution is asymptotically normal when the sample size of the original data considered goes to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, 
there is little discussion on the large sample behaviour of the posterior mean. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap. In particular, we extend the posterior mean idea 
to the conditional mean case, which is conditioning on given vector of summary statistics of the original data. We establish a new asymptotic theory for the conditional 
mean estimator when both the sample size of the original data concerned and the number of Markov chain Monte Carlo iterations go to infinity. Simulation studies show 
that this conditional mean estimator has very good finite sample performance. In addition, we employ the conditional mean estimator to estimate a GARCH(1,1) model for 
S&P 500 stock returns and find that the conditional mean estimator performs better than quasi{maximum likelihood estimation in terms of out-of-sample forecasting.

Abstract: Many applications require forecasts for a hierarchy comprising a set of time series along with aggregates of subsets of these series. 
Although forecasts can be produced independently for each series in the hierarchy, typically this does not lead to coherent forecasts -- the property 
that forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy. State-of-the-art hierarchical forecasting methods usually reconcile the independently 
generated forecasts to satisfy the aggregation constraints. A fundamental limitation of prior research is that it has considered only the problem 
of forecasting the mean of each time series. We consider the situation where probabilistic forecasts are needed for each series in the hierarchy. 
We define forecast coherency in this setting, and propose an algorithm to compute predictive distributions for each series in the hierarchy. 
Our algorithm has the advantage of synthesizing information from different levels in the hierarchy through a sparse forecast combination and 
a probabilistic hierarchical aggregation. We evaluate the accuracy of our forecasting algorithm on both simulated data and large-scale electricity 
smart meter data. The results show consistent performance gains compared to state-of-the art methods.

Keywords: Australian economy, Bayesian VAR, bagging, dynamic factor model, ridge regression, least angular regression, shrinkage, regularization.
Abstract: A popular approach to forecasting macroeconomic variables is to utilize a large number of predictors. Several regularization and 
shrinkage methods can be used to exploit such high-dimensional datasets, and have been shown to improve forecast accuracy for the US economy. 
To assess whether similar results hold for economies with different characteristics, an Australian dataset containing observations on 151 
aggregate and disaggregate economic series is introduced. An extensive empirical study is carried out investigating forecasts at different 
horizons, using a variety of methods and with information sets containing different numbers of predictors. The results share both differences 
and similarities with the conclusions from the literature on forecasting US macroeconomic variables. The major difference is that forecasts 
based on dynamic factor models perform relatively poorly compared to forecasts based on other methods which is the opposite of the conclusion 
made by Stock and Watson (2012) for the US. On the other hand, a conclusion that can be made for both the Australian and US data is that there 
is little to no improvement in forecast accuracy when the number of predictors is expanded beyond 20-40 variables.
