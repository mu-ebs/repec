abstract: Recent empirical work has questioned the consistency of U.S. fiscal policy 
    with an intertemporal budget constraint. Empirical results have tended to 
    indicate that the deficit process has undergone at least one structural shift 
    during recent decades, with the deficit becoming either unsustainable or 
    sustainable in only a weak sense in the post-shift period. In this paper, 
    we re-examine sustainability using a new approach, based on a cointegration 
    model with multiple endogenous breaks.

abstract: This paper estimates the long-term trends in the daily maxima of tropospheric 
    ozone at six sites around the state of Texas. The statistical methodology we 
    use controls for the effects of meteorological variables because it is known 
    that variables such as temperature, wind speed and humidity substantially 
    affect the formation of tropospheric ozone. A nonparametric regression model 
    is estimated in which a general trivaraite surface is used to model the 
    relationship between ozone and these meteorological variables because there 
    is little, or no, theory to specify the functional dependence of ozone on 
    these variables.

    errors are potentially correlated between equations. We show that the prime

    reliable functions estimates than if each of the regression equations was 
    estimated separately and the correlation ignored.

    variables to produce intermediate inputs, which are in turn used to 
    produce final outputs. To show that utility of this new approach, we 
    use it to specify and estimate the Australian GNP function.

    error component can be tested using conditional residuals. When used
        together, these residuals allow identification of outliers, model 
    mis-specification and mean shifts.

    We consider a model where demeaned per capita output of an economy is a 
    function of time trend and then set the convergence hypothesis as negative 
    average slope of that model. Applying the new procedure to 22 OECD countries 
    we find strong evidence of convergence for 20 countries towards their average 
    level. This study also points out why using standard unit root tests with 
        Bernard and Durlauf's (1995) definition of convergence is inappropriate.

abstract: This paper considers the construction of model selection procedures based 
    on choosing the model with the largest maximised log-likelihood mimus a 
    penalty, when key parameters are restricted to be in a closed interval.
    The approach adopted is based on King et al.'s (1995) representative models 
    method with the use of the parametric bootstrap to handle nuisance parameters. 
    The method is illustrated by application to two model selection problems in the 
    context of Box-Cox transformations and the linear regression model. Simulation 
    for both problems indicate that the new procedure clearly dominated existing 
    procedures in terms of having higher probabilities of correctly selecting the 
    true model.

    based on locally fitting a log-linear model, and is in the spirit of recent 
    work on locally parametric techniques in density estimation. The second method 
    is a constrained local polynomial estimator. Both methods always produce 
    non-negative estimators. We propose an algorithm suitable for selecting the 
    two bandwidths for either estimator. We also develop a new bootstrap test for 
    the symmetry of conditional density functions. The proposed methods are 
    illustrated by both simulation and application to a real data set.
