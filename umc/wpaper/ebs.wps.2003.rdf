Abstract: A large number of functional forms have been suggested in the literature for estimating Lorenz curves that describe the relationship between income and population shares. One way of choosing a particular functional form is to pick the one that best fits the data in some sense. Another approach, and the one followed here, is to use Bayesian model averaging to average the alternative functional forms. In this averaging process, the different Lorenz curves are weighted by their posterior probabilities of being correct. Unlike a strategy of picking the best-fitting function, Bayesian model averaging gives posterior standard deviations that reflect the functional form uncertainty. Building on our earlier work (Chotikapanich and Griffiths 2002), we construct likelihood functions using the Dirichlet distribution and estimate a number of Lorenz functions for Australian income units. Prior information is formulated in terms of the Gini coefficient and the income shares of the poorest 10% and poorest 90% of the population. Posterior density functions for these quantities are derived for each Lorenz function and are averaged over all the Lorenz functions.

Abstract: We use US regional and state data to determine which regions have contributed most to the apparent decline in income growth volatility in the United States.  We study changes in the variance of income growth in each region, changes in the covariance of growth between regions and changes in regional income growth shares. We establish that there has been a significant decline in the income growth volatility in thirty eight US states, and it is this, rather than changes in income shares, that is mostly responsible for the decline in the aggregate growth volatility.  Further, we find that the twelve states that show no significant decline in their income growth volatility, are states with policies that make them unattractive to new businesses.  We suggest that state level industrial policy may be a good, albeit partial, explanation for the decline in income growth volatility of the United States.

Abstract: In this paper, the volatility of the return generating process of the market portfolio and the slope coefficient of the market model is assumed to follow a Markov switching process of order one. The results indicate very strong evidence of volatility switching behaviour in a sample of returns in the S&P500 index. In three of the thirty securities in the Dow Jones index, the estimated slope in the market model show strong switching behaviour. In these three securities the low risk state is more persistent than the high-risk state. For each security we estimate the conditional probabilities that the security is in the high (low) risk state given the market is in the high (low) volatility regime and show that this information can be used to classify securities into three distinct groups. There is no association between these groups and the securities' constant beta estimated in the market model and the Sharpe index. Some directions for further research are discussed.

Abstract: This paper proposes neural network based measures of predictability in conditional mean, and then uses them to construct nonlinear analogues to autocorrelograms and partial autocorrelograms.  In contrast to other measures of nonlinear dependence that rely on nonparametric estimation of densities or multivariate integration, our autocorrelograms are simple to calculate and appear to work well in relatively small samples.

Abstract: A perceived increase in correlation during turbulent market conditions implies a reduction in the benefits arising from portfolio diversification. Unfortunately, it is exactly then that these benefits are most needed. To determine whether diversification truly breaks down, we investigate the robustness of a popular conditional correlation estimator against alternative distributional assumptions. Analytical results show that the apparent meltdown in the benefits from diversification could be a consequence of assuming normally distributed returns. A more realistic assumption - the bivariate Student-t distribution - suggests that constant correlation may be sustained over the full support of the multivariate return distribution

Abstract: In this paper Bayesian methods are applied to a stochastic volatility model using both the prices of the asset and the prices of options written on the asset.  Posterior densities for all model parameters, latent volatilities and the market price of volatility risk are produced via a hybrid Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm.  Candidate draws for the unobserved volatilities are obtained by applying the Kalman filter and smoother to a linearization of a state-space representation of the model. The method is illustrated using the Heston (1993) stochastic volatility model applied to Australian News Corporation spot and option price data. Alternative models nested in the Heston framework are ranked via Bayes Factors and via fit, predictive and hedging performance.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to examine the measurement of persistence in a range of time series models nested in the framework of Cramer (1961). This framework is a generalization of the Wold (1938) decomposition for stationary time series which, in addition to accommodating the standard I(0) and I(1) models, caters for alternative nonstationary processes. Three measures of persistence are considered, namely the long-run impulse response, variance ratio and autocorrelation functions. Particular emphasis is given to the behaviour of these measures in a range of nonstationary models. We document conflict that arises between different measures, applied to the same model, as well as conflict arising from the use of a given measure in different models. Precisely which persistence measures are time dependent and which are not, is highlighted. The nature of the general representation used also helps clarify what shock the impulse response function refers to in the case of models where more than one random disturbance impinges on the time series.

Keywords: Interest Rate Models, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Data Augmentation, Nonlinear State Space Models, Kalman Filtering.
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the application of Bayesian simulation-based estimation to a class of interest rate models known as Affine Term Structure (ATS) models. The technique used is based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, with the discrete observations on yields augmented by additional higher frequency latent data. The introduction of augmented yield data reduces the bias associated with estimating a continuous time model using discretely observed data. The technique is demon-strated using a one-factor ATS model, with the latent factor process that underlies the yields sampled via a single-move algorithm. Numerical application of the method is demonstrated using both simulated and empirical data. Extension of the method to a three-factor ATS model is also discussed, as well as the application of a multi-move sampler based on a Kalman Filtering and Smoothing algorithm.

Abstract: A Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methodology is developed for estimating the stochastic conditional duration model.  The conditional mean of durations between trades is modelled as a latent stochastic process, with the conditional distribution of durations having positive support.  The sampling scheme employed is a hybrid of the Gibbs and Metropolis Hastings algorithms, with the latent vector sampled in blocks. The suggested approach is shown to be preferable to the quasi-maximum likelihood approach, and its mixing speed faster than that of an alternative single-move algorithm.  The methodology is illustrated with an application to Australian intraday stock market data.

Keywords: Order statistics, constant relative risk-averse premiums, tail-fatness parameter, beta densities
Abstract: Fat-tailed distributions are used to model claims on general insurance contracts under which extremely large claims are a very real possibility. Since estimation of the tail-fatness parameter is notoriously difficult - it is one of the major outstanding statistical/actuarial problems - methods which do not require precise knowledge are valuable. A characteristic feature of an important class of fat-tailed distributions, Pareto, is that ratios of expected values of large claims in the form {1+E[X(n)]}/{1+E[X(n-k)]} are independent of sample size. For suitably modelled uncertainty about the tail-fatness parameter, premiums to insurers with constant relative risk aversion can be represented in terms of these ratios. Premiums increase with the insurers' risk-aversion and depend upon their perception of the fattest-tailed distribution generating claims.

Keywords: Bandwidth selection, binary classification, kernel estimator, receiver operating characteristic curve.
Abstract: We study methods for constructing confidence intervals, and confidence bands, for estimators of receiver operating characteristics.  Particular emphasis is placed on the way in which smoothing should be implemented, when estimating either the characteristic itself or its variance.  We show that substantial undersmoothing is necessary if coverage properties are not to be impaired.  A theoretical analysis of the problem suggests an empirical, plug-in rule for bandwidth choice, optimising the coverage accuracy of interval estimators.  The performance of this approach is explored.  Our preferred technique is based on asymptotic approximation, rather than a more sophisticated approach using the bootstrap, since the latter requires a multiplicity of smoothing parameters all of which must be chosen in nonstandard ways.  It is shown that the asymptotic method can give very good performance.

Keywords: Self-employment, captivity.
Abstract: Modelling the incidence of self-employment has traditionally proved problematic. Whilst the individual supply side characteristics of the self-employed are well documented, the literature has largely neglected (or misspecified) demand side aspects. In this paper we present results from an econometric framework that allows us to separately, and simultaneously, model the supply and demand side characteristics that determine employment outcomes. We show that whilst individual characteristics are important determinants of the type of employment contract that individuals hold, there are also important contract specific factors that influence the nature of the contract an individual is employed under. Our results suggest that workers may be "captive" to a particular type of employment because of the sector in which they work, the number of hours they prefer to work and their ethnicity.  The results are based on a new estimator, the parameterised DOGEV model, which allows for ordering and correlation in the observed alternatives, and for captivity within an observed alternative.

Keywords: Box-Cox transformation, leverage effect, sampling algorithm.
Abstract: The stochastic volatility model enjoys great success in modeling the time-varying volatility of asset returns.  There are several specifications for volatility including the most popular one which allows logarithmic volatility to follow an autoregressive Gaussian process, known as log-normal stochastic volatility.  However, from an econometric viewpoint, we lack a procedure to choose an appropriate functional form for volatility.  Instead of the log-normal specification, Yu, Yang and Zhang (2002) assumed Box-Cox transformed volatility follows an autoregressive Gaussian process. However, the empirical evidence they found from currency markets is not strong enough to support the Box-Cox transformation against the alternatives, and it is necessary to seek further empirical evidence from the equity market.  This paper develops a sampling algorithm for the Box-Cox stochastic volatility model with a leverage effect incorporated.  When the model and the sampling algorithm are applied to the equity market, we find strong empirical evidence to support the Box-Cox transformation of volatility.  In addition, the empirical study shows that it is important to incorporate the leverage effect into stochastic volatility models when the volatility of returns on a stock index is under investigation.

Abstract: We apply a logistic smooth transition market model (LSTM) to a sample of returns on Australian industry portfolios to investigate whether bull and bear market betas differ. Unlike other studies, our LSTM model allows for smooth transition between bull and bear states and allows the data to determine the threshold value. The estimated value of the smoothness parameter was very large for all industries implying that transition is abrupt. Therefore we estimated the threshold as a parameter along with the two betas in a dual beta market (DBM) framework using a sequential conditional least squares (SCLS) method. Using Lagrange Multiplier type tests of linearity, and the SCLS method our results indicate that for all but two industries the bull and bear betas are significantly different.

Keywords: Forecasting; Discrete Time Series; INAR(1); Bayesian Prediction; Bayesian Model Averaging.
Abstract: The application of traditional forecasting methods to discrete count data yields forecasts that are non-coherent.  That is, such methods produce non-integer point and interval predictions which violate the restrictions on the sample space of the integer variable.  This paper presents a methodology for producing coherent forecasts of low count time series.  The forecasts are based on estimates of the p-step ahead predictive mass functions for a family of distributions nested in the integer-valued first-order autoregressive (INAR(1)) class.  The predictive mass functions are constructed from convolutions of the unobserved components of the model, with uncertainty associated with both parameter values and model specifcation fully incorporated.  The methodology is used to analyse two sets of Canadian wage loss claims data.

Abstract: This paper compares the performance of several tests for stochastic dominance up to order three using Monte Carlo methods.  The tests considered are the Davidson and Duclos (2000) test, the Anderson test (1996) and the Kaur, Rao and Singh (1994) test. Only unpaired samples of independent observations are considered, as this is a restriction for both the Anderson and Kaur-Rao-Singh tests.  We find that the Davidson-Duclos test appears to be the best. The Kaur-Rao-Singh test is overly conservative and does not compare favorably against the Davidson-Duclos and Anderson tests in terms of power.

Keywords: Bayesian Option Pricing; Leptokurtosis; Skewness; Time-Varying Volatility; Option Price Prediction; Implied Volatility Smiles
Abstract: A new class of option price models is developed and applied to options on the Australian S&P200 Index. The class of models generalizes the traditional Black-Scholes framework by accommodating time-varying conditional volatility, skewness and excess kurtosis in the underlying returns process. An important property of the more general pricing models is that the computational requirements are practically the same as those associated with the Black-Scholes model, with both methods being based on one-dimensional integrals. Bayesian inferential methods are used to evaluate a range of models nested in the general framework, using observed market option prices. The evaluation is based on posterior distributions estimated for the parameters of the alternative models, as well as posterior model probabilities, out-of-sample predictive performance and implied volatility smiles. The empirical results provide strong evidence that time-varying volatility, leptokurtosis and skewness are priced in Australian stock market options.

Keywords: Bayesian Option Pricing; Leptokurtosis; Skewness; GARCH Option Pricing; Option Price Prediction; Hedging Errors.
Abstract: A Bayesian approach to option pricing is presented, in which posterior inference about the underlying returns process is conducted implicitly via observed option prices.  A range of models allowing for conditional leptokurtosis, skewness and time-varying volatility in returns are considered, with posterior parameter distributions and model probabilities backed out from the option prices. Models are ranked according to several criteria, including out-of-sample fit, predictive and hedging performance. The methodology accommodates heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in the option pricing errors, as well as regime shifts across contract groups. The method is applied to intraday option price data on the S&P500 stock index for 1995. Whilst the results provide support for models which accommodate leptokurtosis, no one model dominates according to all criteria considered.

Keywords: Evolutionary Spectra, Adaptive Smoothing, M3-Competition
Abstract: In this paper, an adaptive smoothing forecasting approach based on evolutionary spectra as developed by Rao and Shapiro (1970) is applied to the 3003 time series of various types and lengths used in the M3-Competition (Makridakis and Hibon, 2000). Comparisons of out-of-sample forecasts are made with other methods used in the M3-Competition via the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). It will be seen that this method does appear to perform very well when applied specifically to yearly, quarterly and monthly macro time series and to yearly and monthly demographic time series used in the competition.

Keywords: exponential smoothing, invertibility, state space models.
Abstract: In this article we discuss invertibility conditions for some state space models, including the models that underly simple exponential smoothing, Holt's linear method, Holt-Winters' additive method and damped trend versions of Holt's and Holt-Winters' methods. The parameter space for which the model is invertible is compared to the usual parameter regions. We find that the usual parameter restrictions (requiring all smoothing parameters to lie between 0 and 1) do not always lead to invertible models. Conversely, some invertible models have parameters which lie outside the usual region. We also find that all seasonal exponential smoothing methods are non-invertible when the usual equations are used. However, this does not affect the forecast mean. Alternative models are presented which solve the problem while retaining the basic exponential smoothing ideas.

Keywords: Exponential smoothing; forecasting; information criteria; M3 competition; model selection.
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new Empirical Information Criterion (EIC) for model selection which penalizes the likelihood of the data by a function of the number of parameters in the model. It is designed to be used where there are a large number of time series to be forecast. However, a bootstrap version of the EIC can be used where there is a single time series to be forecast. The EIC provides a data-driven model selection tool that can be tuned to the particular forecasting task.  We compare the EIC with other model selection criteria including Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and Schwarz's Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The comparisons show that for the M3 forecasting competition data, the EIC outperforms both the AIC and BIC, particularly for longer forecast horizons. We also compare the criteria on simulated data and find that the EIC does better than existing criteria in that case also.

Keywords: Croston's method, exponential smoothing, forecasting, intermittent demand.
Abstract: Intermittent demand commonly occurs with inventory data, with many time periods having no demand and small demand in the other periods.  Croston's method is a widely used procedure for intermittent demand forecasting. However, it is an ad hoc method with no properly formulated underlying stochastic model.  In this paper, we explore possible models underlying Croston's method and three related methods, and we show that any underlying model will be inconsistent with the properties of intermittent demand data. However, we find that the point forecasts and prediction intervals based on such underlying models may still be useful.
